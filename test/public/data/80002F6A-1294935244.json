When the people fail, the ships fail. our goal here is to learn why these failures occur and thereby to stop them before they happen. this study of all the human factors aboard ship (that is, the manner in which people work together with their equipment, available information, and each other) is known as bridge resource management (BrM).Michael R. Adams is a master mariner, certified stCW instructor, retired U.s. Coast Guard commander, and current member of the Florida Bar. During his two decades in the Coast Guard, he served in the cutters Absecon, Boutwell, Dependable, Midgett, Steadfast, and Ute, progressing from deck watch officer to commanding officer. He also served as navigator of the barque UsCGC Eagle. after his Coast Guard service, he spent 11 years as captain of the large oil spill response vessel Delaware Responder with brief intervals as captain of the California Responder, Maine Responder, and Virginia Responder.

As Long as Its Fun is as much a love story as it is a sea yarn, and, like all such stories, its not without complications . . . which makes it not only a sailing tale but also a human one.Reviews for As Long As It's Fun Every story needs a storyteller. The fascinating tale of Lin and Larry Pardey stretches across nearly half a century and touches much of the earth and its oceans, shared lives pulsing with adventure, creativity and passion. Herb McCormick navigates the Pardeys sprawling journey like one of their own cutters skimming along the surface of a calm sea. They lived in many worlds and McCormicks prose slips seamlessly among them, whether describing the complexities of boat construction, the breathtaking beauty and harrowing danger of global navigation or the economics of life on the fly. Lin and Larry thrived in an esoteric life of their own making; McCormick is a genial and informed guide with an insiders knowledge and a poets voice. In his hands, their journey is ours.  Tim Layden, Senior Writer, Sports Illustrated Long before Lin and Larry encouraged us to keep cruising As Long as its Fun, they exhorted us to unshackle our landlubberly chains and Go Simple, Go Small, Go Now. Four decades, many books and oceans later, the minimalist adventurers chose master storyteller Herb McCormick to bring their story home, which he has done superblyfrom childhood memories to burying the anchor in New Zealand. Serious sailors will learn things valuable about voyaging under sailand about life.  Dan Spurr, author of Steered by the Falling Stars, River of Forgotten Days Opening at an anxious moment in Taleisin near Cape Horn, Herb McCormick insightfully and vividly tells the fascinating story of the active lives and always challenging times of the most famous couple afloat. He makes clear not only how but why, after more than 170,000 miles of voyaging in wooden boats, the Pardeys remain as colorful, controversial, and influential as ever. John Rousmaniere, author, The Annapolis Book of Seamanship, Fastnet, Force 10, etc. \"Im a sailor, Ive read all their books, I thought I knew most of it. But Herb McCormicks story of the extraordinary life of Lin and Larry Pardey blew me far away. While inhabiting our world, the Pardeys discovered another one for themselves that may be the stuff of all our dreams, but is beyond the grasp of most of us. They told us that we could get there ourselves by doing as they did, but the Pardeys are hard-working, Houdini-calibre escapologists from the world the rest of us have lived in. This is in fact the rarest of tales, a story of the life two people lived that is as fabulous as the Arabian Nights, as Stanley in Africa, as any exploration of the Right Stuff in SpaceThats one part of this book. The other is the Pardeys singularly qualified biographer. Herb McCormick has written professionally about the sea and cruising sailors for forty years; he has sailed the globe from Polar icecap to Cape Horn, in every kind of boat and weather. No onenot even the Pardeyscould frame this story as clearly and contextually as Herb McCormick has in this magnificent book. This is a life story to set alongside Slocum, Scott, Amundsen, Lindberg, or Odysseus.\"   Peter Nichols, author of international bestsellers,Evolutions Captain and A Voyage for Madmen ","price":"10.42","product_url":"http://www.paracay.com/as-long-as-its-fun-the-epic-voyages-and-extraordinary-times-of-lin-and-larry-pardey/","highlight:":"highlight"}]}
