In A Moveable Feast, Hemingway speaks of sitting in a caf in Paris and writing about what he knew best -- and when it came time to stop, he \"did not want to leave the river\" The story was the unforgettable classic, \"Big Two-Hearted River,\" and from its first words we do not want to leave the river either. He also wrote articles for the Toronto Star on fishing in Canada and Europe and, later, articles for Esquire about his growing passion for big-game fishing. His last books, The Old Man and the Sea and Islands in the Stream, celebrate his vast knowledge of the ocean and his affection for its great denizens. . Hemingway on Fishing is an encompassing, diverse, and fascinating collection. From the early Nick Adams stories and the memorable chapters on fishing the Irati River in The Sun Also Rises to such late novels as Islands in the Stream, this collection traces the evolution of a great writer's passion; the range of his interests; the sure use he made of fishing, transforming it into the stuff of great literature. . Anglers and lovers of great writing alike will welcome this important collection.

Maybe we need to go down to the river bank and try to listen.\"In what he says is the most important piece of environmental writing in his long and award-winning career, Mark Kurlansky, best-selling author ofSaltandCod,The Big Oyster, 1968,andMilk, among many others, employs his signature multi-century storytelling and compelling attention to detail to chronicle the harrowing yet awe-inspiring life cycle of salmon.During his research Kurlansky traveled widely and observed salmon and those who both pursue and protect them in the Pacific and the Atlantic, in Ireland, Norway, Iceland, Japan, and even the robust but not as frequently visited Kamchatka Peninsula. This world tour reveals an eras-long history of mans misdirected attempts to manipulate salmon and its environments for his own benefit and gain, whether for entertainment or to harvest food.In addition, Kurlanskys research shows that all over the world these fish, uniquely connected to both marine and terrestrial ecology as well as fresh and salt water, are a natural barometer for the health of the planet. He documents that for centuries mans greatest assaults on nature, from overfishing to dams, from hatcheries to fish farms, from industrial pollution to the ravages of climate change, are evidenced in the sensitive life cycle of salmon.With stunning historical and contemporary photographs and illustrations throughout, Kurlanskys insightful conclusion is that the only way to save salmon is to save the planet and, at the same time, the only way to save the planet is to save the mighty, heroic salmon.","price":"18.00","product_url":"http://www.paracay.com/salmon-a-fish-the-earth-and-the-history-of-their-common-fate/","highlight:":"no highlight"},{"SKU":"INT095","SKUCategory":"ZRH","Title":"12Volt Bible for Boats 2nd ed, 9780071392334, $25.00  [640]","Title2":null,"Times":31,"Quantity":56,"image_url":"http://www.paracay.com/images/thumbnails/400/400/detailed/14/INT095.jpg","description":"A clear, non-threatening introduction to 12-volt electrical systems used on small boats.

Baleen was worth nearly $5 a pound. But the new trading posts brought guns, alcohol, and disease. In 1905, a new type of whaling using modern steel whale-catchers and harpoon cannons appeared along the Alaskan coast. Yet the Inuit and Inupiat continue whaling today from approximately 15 small towns scattered along the Arctic Ocean and the Bering Strait.

Frigid temperatures brought pack ice that filled the waters north of the Bering Strait. As a result, virtually the entire North American whaling fleet was trapped, stranding 300 men to die of starvation and exposure. Three escaping ships raised the alarm. Answering the call, three officers from the early U. S. Coast Guard and two missionaries volunteered to travel over 1,500 miles through the Arctic winter to reach the shipwrecked whalers. The rescuers' perilous four-month journey, through mountainous territory and barren sub-zero landscapes never before traversed, was fraught with blizzards, wolves, steep terrain, unstable ice, hunters, and bone-piercing cold. Unaware that a rescue team was on the way, the shipwrecked men endured freezing temperatures, malnutrition, and scurvy before falling into general lawlessness. Their struggles and those of the rescuers are meticulously recreated here from century-old journals. This extraordinary chronicle of hardship and heroism will take you to the heart of one of America's greatest maritime disasters-and the greatest Arctic rescue story in history. .

In 1900, the four great geographical mysteries-the Northwest Passage, the Northeast Passage, the South Pole, and the North Pole-remained blank spots on the globe. Within twenty years Roald Amundsen would claim all four prizes. Renowned for his determination and technical skills, both feared and beloved by his men, Amundsen is a legend of the heroic age of exploration, which shortly thereafter would be tamed by technology, commerce, and publicity. Fted in his lifetime as an international celebrity, pursued by women and creditors, he died in the Arctic on a rescue mission for an inept rival explorer. Stephen R. Bown has unearthed archival material to give Amundsen's life the grim immediacy of Apsley Cherry-Garrard's The Worst Journey in the World, the exciting detail of The Endurance, and the suspense of a Jon Krakauer tale. The Last Viking is both a thrilling literary biography and a cracking good story.","price":"10.79","product_url":"http://www.paracay.com/the-last-viking-the-life-of-roald-amundsen-clone/","highlight:":"no highlight"},{"SKU":"MAC004","SKUCategory":"ZRH","Title":"Marine Mammals of North America, 9780898862188, $6.95  [FILE CABINET]","Title2":null,"Times":14,"Quantity":43,"image_url":"http://www.paracay.com/images/thumbnails/400/400/detailed/14/MAC004.jpg","description":"Two-sided plastic laminated cards developed by a teacher of marine science.

Denali, the highest peak in North America at 20,320 feet, is still rising, pushed upward as a tectonic plate collides from the south. The collision has also created huge mountains along Alaska s Gulf Coast, where humid coastal air has produced the largest subpolar icefield in North America. The exceptional heights of Alaska s mountains are mirrored below sea level by the 22,377-foot-deep trench of the active subduction zone along Alaska s southern shore. Earthquakes associated with the subduction zone shake Alaskans frequently, and the magnitude 9.2 earthquake in 1964, with its epicenter in Prince William Sound, was one of the largest seismic events everrecorded.Such an active geologic setting calls for an updated edition of this popular roadside geology guide. Since the first edition was published in 1988, volcanoes have erupted, faults have ruptured, glaciers have retreated, permafrost has thawed, and geologic interpretations have changed. Author Cathy Connor discusses the latest findings as she guides readers along the roads of Alaska and adjacent parts of British Columbia and the Yukon. In addition to roads and national parks, the book covers the boatside geology of Alaska, including the fjords of southeast Alaska, islands in the Bering Sea, and the Tatshenshini River.

Her father, Captain Hosea Lewis, became the first keeper of Lime Rock Lighthouse in 1853. But after he was disabled by stroke, then-fifteen-year-old Ida and her mother took over the tending of the Lime Rock Light from 1857 until 1872, when her father died. Her mother was appointed lighthouse keeper and remained in this position until she died in 1879, even though Ida continued to do the work. In 1879, Ida was officially appointed to the job, which she remained in until her death in 1911. Ida is credited with saving at least eighteen lives during her nearly forty years on the tiny island in Newport Harbor. She became famous nationwide in the late 1860s after one of her daring rescues, and the town of Newport celebrated her on Independence Day 1869. In 1924 the Rhode Island legislature officially changed the name of Lime Rock to Ida Lewis Rock. In 1995, a new class of Coast Guard buoy tenders was named for her.","price":"8.97","product_url":"http://www.paracay.com/lighthouse-keepers-daughter/","highlight:":"no highlight"},{"SKU":"NO_16590","SKUCategory":"NOAA","Title":"HISTORICAL NOAA Chart 16590: Kodiak Island Sitkinak Strait and Alitak Bay, 44 x 36, $24.95 [ TP ]","Title2":"HISTORICAL NOAA Chart 16590: Kodiak Island Sitkinak Strait and Alitak Bay, 44 x 36, $24.95 [ TP ]","Times":10,"Quantity":28,"image_url":"http://www.paracay.com/images/thumbnails/400/400/product/11/16590.jpg","description":"This chart has been canceled by NOAA as of 11/30/2022and is no longer maintained with updated data.Chart is NOT up-to-date since it is out of continual maintenance Chart is NOT updated daily and being printed on demand will NOT provide the latest published data possibleThis is NOT the most fully corrected, up-to-date U.S. charts availableChart is NOT updated weekly and does NOT include all of the latest Notice to Mariners corrections.The data from which this POD chart is produced is NOT certified by NOAA for navigation use, and is NOT correct to the date of printingFuture Notice to Mariners corrections will NOT be applied to this chartThis product will NOT meet U.

It's something we do everywhere, whether feeling our way through a bedroom in the dark, or charting a ship's course. But how does navigation affect our brains, our memory, ourselves? Blending scientific research and memoir, and written in beautiful prose,&nbsp;Finding North&nbsp;starts with a quest by the author to understand this most basic of human skills---and why it's in mortal peril.In 1844, Foy's great-great grandfather, captain of a Norwegian cargo ship, perished at sea after getting lost in a snowstorm. Foy decides to unravel the mystery surrounding Halvor Michelsen's death---and the roots of his own obsession with navigation---by re-creating his ancestor's trip using only period instruments.Beforehand, he meets a colorful cast of characters to learn whether men really have better directional skills than women, how cells, eels, and spaceships navigate; and how tragedy results from GPS glitches. He interviews a cabby who has memorized every street in London, sails on a Haitian cargo sloop, and visits the site of a secret navigational cult in Greece.At the heart of Foy's story is this fact: navigation and the brain's memory centers are inextricably linked. As Foy unravels the secret behind Halvor's death, he also discovers why forsaking our navigation skills in favor of GPS may lead not only to Alzheimers and other diseases of memory, but to losing a key part of what makes us human.","price":"15.59","product_url":"http://www.paracay.com/finding-north-how-navigation-makes-us-human/","highlight:":"no highlight"},{"SKU":"FMC002","SKUCategory":"ZRH","Title":"Puget Sound South, 761428091017, $14.95 [SP023]","Title2":null,"Times":18,"Quantity":20,"image_url":"http://www.paracay.com/images/thumbnails/400/400/detailed/26/FMC002.jpg","description":"Features:20 foot underwater depth contoursUnderwater features identified including wrecks, weedbeds, artificial reefs, dredged channelsLatitude and Longitude Grids with Over 90 GPS Coordinates IdentifiedNumerous Fish Locations presented throughout chartFishing Strategies (Ideas)Artificial Reefs DataBoat ramps, Campgrounds and Facilities information providedWaterproof and Tear-resistant plastic, folds to 9x4, unfolds to 3x2, 2-sided chartMade by a Fisherman for Fishermen and Other Water EnthusiastsMADE IN THE U.S.A.","price":"8.97","product_url":"http://www.paracay.com/fish-n-map-puget-sound-south-olympia-tacoma-seattle/","highlight:":"no highlight"},{"SKU":"HCB118","SKUCategory":"ZRH","Title":"Baby Fox, 9781452181738, $7.99 [2508]","Title2":null,"Times":5,"Quantity":20,"image_url":"http://www.paracay.com/images/thumbnails/400/400/detailed/42/HCB118.jpg","description":"Baby Fox Finger Puppet Bookis a sweet, entertaining board book with a finger puppet built right in.Where does Baby Fox play?

He brought as his guide a primer on Greek myths written by his friend Lady Hestia Evans, a devotee of Lord Byron who had recently taken the same voyage. In the true Romantic spirit, Lady Hestias book was not only lavishly illustrated but also boasted many paper crafts and novelties, including a card game featuring the twelve Olympians, an oak-leaf oracle of Zeus, a pop-up Pandoras box (with hope still inside), a booklet retelling the tale of Odysseus, a piece of the Golden Fleece, a gold OBOLOS coin to pay the ferryman on the River Styx, and many more flaps, foldouts, and other surprises. The nobleman added his own witty comments and drawings along the way, but seems to have wished for something odd at the Delphic oracle: as the book nears its end, it slowly begins to turn . . . to gold.

Written by a master storyteller, World Without Fish connects all the dots- biology, economics, evolution, politics, climate, history, culture, food, and nutrition in a way that kids can really understand. It describes how the fish we most commonly eat, including tuna, salmon, cod, and swordfish, could disappear within 50 years, and the domino effect it would have oceans teeming with jellyfish and turning pinkish orange from algal blooms; seabirds disappearing, then reptiles, then mammals. It describes the back-and-forth dynamic of fishermen and scientists. It covers the effects of industrialized fishing, and how bottom-dragging nets are turning the ocean floor into a desert. The answer' Support sustainable fishing. World Without Fish tells kids exactly what they can do: Find out where those fish sticks come from. Tell your parents what's good to buy, and what's not. Ask the waiter if the fish on the menu is line-caught And follow simple rules: Use less plastic, and never eat endangered fish like Bluefin tuna. Interwoven with the book is a full-color graphic novel. Each beautifully illustrated chapter opener links to form a larger fictional story that complements the text.

Now he performs the same alchemy with the Big Burn, the largest-ever forest fire in America and the tragedy that cemented Teddy Roosevelt's legacy in the land.On the afternoon of August 20, 1910, a battering ram of wind moved through the drought-stricken national forests of Washington, Idaho, Montana, whipping the hundreds of small blazes burning across the forest floor into a roaring inferno that jumped from treetop to ridge as it raged, destroying towns and timber in an eyeblink. Forest rangers had assembled nearly ten thousand men-- college boys, day-workers, immigrants from mining camps-- to fight the fires. But no living person had seen anything like those flames, and neither the rangers nor anyone else knew how to subdue them.Egan narrates the struggles of the overmatched rangers against the implacable fire with unstoppable dramatic force, through the eyes of the people who lived it. Equally dramatic, though, is the larger story he tells of outsized president Teddy Roosevelt and his chief forester Gifford Pinchot. Pioneering the notion of conservation, Roosevelt and Pinchot did nothing less than create the idea of public land as our national treasure, owned by every citizen. The robber barons fought him and the rangers charged with protecting the reserves, but even as TR's national forests were smoldering they were saved: The heroism shown by those same rangers turned public opinion permanently in favor of the forests,though it changed the mission of the forest service with consequences felt in the fires of today.THE BIG BURN tells an epic story, paints a moving portrait of the people who lived it, and offers a critical cautionary tale for our time.","price":"11.39","product_url":"http://www.paracay.com/the-big-burn-teddy-roosevelt-and-the-fire-that-saved-america/","highlight:":"no highlight"},{"SKU":"STL030","SKUCategory":"ZRH","Title":"Moonshine!, 9781579906481, $16.95  [001828]","Title2":null,"Times":9,"Quantity":12,"image_url":"http://www.paracay.com/images/thumbnails/400/400/product/3/STL030.jpg","description":"Recipes, tall tales, drinking songs, hangover cures, history and keeping in step with the law.

But mushrooms are only fruiting bodies, analogous to apples on a tree. Most fungi live out of sight, yet make up a massively diverse kingdom of organisms that supports and sustains nearly all living systems. Fungi provide a key to understanding the planet on which we live, and the ways we think, feel, and behave.InEntangled Life, the brilliant young biologist Merlin Sheldrake shows us the world from a fungal point of view, providing an exhilarating change of perspective. Sheldrakes vivid exploration takes us from yeast to psychedelics, to the fungi that range for miles underground and are the largest organisms on the planet, to those that link plants together in complex networks known as the Wood Wide Web, to those that infiltrate and manipulate insect bodies with devastating precision.Fungi throw our concepts of individuality and even intelligence into question. They are metabolic masters, earth makers, and key players in most of lifes processes. They can change our minds, heal our bodies, and even help us remediate environmental disaster.

Today we are rediscovering what they have long known: seaweed provides a nutritional punch, a powerful mix of iodine, iron, vitamin C, antioxidants, fiber, vitamin K, vitamin B12; minerals, fiber and protein. It is linked to lower rates of cardiovascular disease, Type 2 diabetes and obesity and it is believed to help in the prevention and treatment of cancer.The Seaweed Cookbookcovers all aspects of seaweed. It is for those who would like to incorporate this powerful food into their diet and it is for those who already enjoy it and want to discover new recipes. The book explains the benefits of eating seaweed, where to buy it, how to collect it (if you're lucky enough to live seaside), and how to dry, store, soak and handle it as an ingredient. Most importantly, there are 50 easy and delicious recipes.There are many kinds of seaweed used in the recipes, each with its own taste profile, uses and benefits:Arame - mild, almost sweet, the best introduction to sea vegetablesNori - the common sushi wrapper, great toastedKombu - an aromatic base for a broth, used in miso soup and other Japanese dishesWakame - related to kombu, believed to have fat burning properties that could fight obesityHijiki - for natural beauty, its deep black color can be off-putting for some peopleDulse - a snack seaweed packed with protein and iron, often used as a saltAgar - used as a thickener in sweet and savory dishes, with mild laxative propertiesKelp - packed with vitamins, minerals and iodine; useful for a number of health issuesAlaria - light green and almost transparentSea palm - wavy fronds are mild, almost nutty-tasting.The Seaweed Cookbookincludes recipes for appetizers, main and side dishes, baking, such as scones and shortbread, an amazing granola and as a chocolate flavoring. A little seaweed goes a long way, so it is perfect as a seasoning, whether in salt or infused in oils and dressings, and mixed with seeds.

He demonstrates the critical role of maritime trade to the civilizations of ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, and the Indus Valley. He reacquaints us with the great seafaring cultures of antiquity like those of the Phoenicians and Greeks, as well as those of India and Southeast and East Asia, who parlayed their navigational skills, shipbuilding techniques, and commercial acumen to establish thriving overseas colonies and trade routes in the centuries leading up to the age of European expansion. And finally, his narrative traces how commercial shipping and naval warfare brought about the enormous demographic, cultural, and political changes that have globalized the world throughout the postCold War era.This tremendously readable intellectual adventure shows us the world in a new light, in which the sea reigns supreme. We find out how a once-enslaved East African king brought Islam to his people, what the American sail-around territories were, and what the Song Dynasty did with twenty-wheel, human-powered paddleboats with twenty paddle wheels and up to three hundred crew.

A decade ago, farmed Atlantic salmon replaced tuna as the most popular fish on North America's dinner tables. We are told salmon is healthy and environmentally friendly. The reality is disturbingly different. In Salmon Wars, investigative journalists Douglas Frantz and Catherine Collins bring readers to massive ocean feedlots where millions of salmon are crammed into parasite-plagued cages and fed a chemical-laced diet. The authors reveal the conditions inside hatcheries, where young salmon are treated like garbage, and at the farms that threaten our fragile coasts. They draw colorful portraits of characters, such as the big salmon farmer who poisoned his own backyard, the fly-fishing activist who risked everything to ban salmon farms in Puget Sound, and the American researcher driven out of Norway for raising the alarm about dangerous contaminants in the fish. Frantz and Collins document how the industrialization of Atlantic salmon threatens this keystone species, endangers our health and environment, and lines the pockets of our generation's version of Big Tobacco. And they show how it doesn't need to be this way.

Born into a poor, obscure family, he worked his way rapidly up in the maritime world to his first captaincy. Before long, he was the most successful of all English pirates, admired by his countrymen, hated and feared by the Spanish.Queen Elizabeth and her ministers saw the potential in this rough-mannered but enterprising young man, and gave him their blessing for the first British venture into the Pacific Ocean. This success of this voyage, which lasted for three years, exceeded their wildest hopes. Not only did Drake come home with a vast treasure of captured gold, silver and jewels; he became the first man ever to circumnavigate the globe in a single mission, and bring most of his crew home alive and well. Soon after his triumphant return, Elizabeth knighted this newly rich adventurer, and gave her blessing to his acts of pillage. It was a gesture that made war with Spain inevitable. And Drakes part in the coming war changed the course of world history.","price":"7.77","product_url":"http://www.paracay.com/the-queens-pirate-sir-francis-drake-and-the-golden-hind/","highlight:":"no highlight"},{"SKU":"NO_16549","SKUCategory":"NOAA","Title":"HISTORICAL NOAA Chart 16549: Cold Bay and approaches: Alaska Pen.;King Cove Harbor, 36 x 48, $24...","Title2":"HISTORICAL NOAA Chart 16549: Cold Bay and approaches: Alaska Pen.;King Cove Harbor, 36 x 48, $24...","Times":4,"Quantity":7,"image_url":"http://www.paracay.com/images/thumbnails/400/400/product/17/16549.jpg","description":"This chart has been canceled by NOAA as of 07/6/22and is no longer maintained with updated data.Chart is NOT up-to-date since it is out of continual maintenance Chart is NOT updated daily and being printed on demand will NOT provide the latest published data possibleThis is NOT the most fully corrected, up-to-date U.S. charts availableChart is NOT updated weekly and does NOT include all of the latest Notice to Mariners corrections.The data from which this POD chart is produced is NOT certified by NOAA for navigation use, and is NOT correct to the date of printingFuture Notice to Mariners corrections will NOT be applied to this chartThis product will NOT meet U.

In the United States, the most common pan is a simple 12-inch skillet. Here youll find 125 recipes that will transform and expand the way you use this versatile piece of cookware.To liberate the skillet from commonplace fare, we share what weve learned from our travels and from cooks in more than 35 countries. We drew inspiration from the East African islands ofMauritius and Runion forShrimp Rougaille, based on a Creole tomato sauce that reflects European and Indian influences. And inIndia, a wok-like vessel called a kadai or karahi is common. We use a skillet instead to makeChicken Curry with Tomatoes and Bell Peppers.The skillet also is a good choice for the stir-fried Sichuan classicSpicy Glass Noodles with Ground Pork, fragrant Vietnamese-Style Lemon Grass Tofu, and Mexican-Style Cauliflower Rice. You can even use it to make Three-Cheese Pasta, Skillet-Roasted Peruvian-style Chicken, and Pizza with Fennel Salami and Red Onion.To make it easy to find the recipe you need, we organized chapters by cooking times (an hour or less, 45 minutes, and under 30 minutes) as well as sections for side dishes, pastas, grains, stir-fries, pan roasts, and skillet-griddled sandwiches. And because the cooking is limited to one pan, the techniques are straightforward and the clean-up is easy.Great cooking is rarely about which pan you put on your stove. Its about what you put inside it.

InThe Bomber Mafia,Gladwell asks, Was it worth it?Things might have gone differently had LeMays predecessor, General Haywood Hansell, remained in charge.

Despite the fact that his father fiercely denied any connection, he found Indigenous people alluring, often recalling his grandmothers consistent mention of their Chippewa heritage.When La Tray attended his grandfathers funeral as a young man, he finally found himself surrounded by relatives who obviously were Indigenous.

But it was also here, in 1859, that the United States and Great Britain nearly went to war over a dead pig. On July 18 of that year, Capt. George E. Pickett (later to lead the famous charge climaxing the Battle of Gettysburg) landed his company of 63 soldiers on the southern end of San Juan Island to protect U.S. citizens from the British government after an American settler, LymanCutlar, had shot a pig belonging to the British-owned Hudsons Bay Company. What was really at stake was the possession of the entire San Juan archipelago, held in dispute between the two nations since 1846. By the time the crisis was settled, nearly 500 U.S. soldiers and three British warships would stand off on Griffin Bay. It would then require12 more years of joint military occupation before the international boundary was settled and the San Juans became U.S. territory.","price":"14.99","product_url":"http://www.paracay.com/the-pig-war/","highlight:":"no highlight"},{"SKU":"PER194","SKUCategory":"ZRH","Title":"Tales of Ordinary Madness, 9780872861558, $15.95 [450]","Title2":null,"Times":2,"Quantity":4,"image_url":"http://www.paracay.com/images/thumbnails/400/400/detailed/45/PER194_smf2-q7.jpg","description":"With Bukowski, the votes are still coming in.

Traversing some of the most treacherous waters on earth, the journey would have been a risky act for an extreme adventurer in any era; for a young woman in the conservative 1930s, it was a venture of almost unimaginable daring. Betty pulled it off, and now, 67 years later, she accomplishes an equal feat--a book of pure adventure. Bijaboji is a classic of boating literature worthy of a place beside&nbsp;The Curve of Time&nbsp;by Muriel Wylie Blanchet, whose coastal narrative dates from the same period.Betty slips through quiet water by moonlight, her oars dripping with phosphorescence. She goes deer hunting with a young Native man near Sechelt. She travels with a boat full of exuberant Boy Scouts for a few days and she visits lightkeepers, loggers, fishermen, doctors, missionaries and other coast dwellers who live in beautiful, isolated places and who speak openly about their lives, loves and politics. She also braves storms, rapids and blistering heat. In Douglas Channel Bijaboji capsizes and Betty loses her oarsand everything she owns, except her boat and her sleeping bag. She is trapped on a precarious rock ledge for three harrowing days until rescued by Native fishermen.Through it all, she copes with her growing celebrity as people all along the coast watch for her, at the same time as they wait for news on the abdication of Edward VIII and on the disappearance of another female adventurer, Amelia Earhart. This is an amazing account written by a smart, strong, funny, independent woman with a glad heart and an abiding love of the BC coast.","price":"14.97","product_url":"http://www.paracay.com/bijaboji-north-to-alaska-by-oar/","highlight:":"no highlight"},{"SKU":"PGN294","SKUCategory":"ZRH","Title":"Little Red Riding Hood of the Pacific Northwest,  9781632171832, $17.99 [1015]","Title2":null,"Times":2,"Quantity":3,"image_url":"http://www.paracay.com/images/thumbnails/400/400/detailed/45/PGN294.jpg","description":"A well-known fairy tale takes on a new twist!Once upon a time on the shore of the Salish Sea lived a bold, brave young girl bursting with the spirit of adventure.

When the young couple stepped aboard the neglected vessel, her sturdy work-boat style captured their hearts with an ageless beauty that only the young dreamers could see.

But it would take the world some time to believe that the age of flight had begun, with the first powered machine carrying a pilot.Orville and Wilbur Wright were men of exceptional courage and determination, and of far-ranging intellectual interests and ceaseless curiosity. When they worked together, no problem seemed to be insurmountable. Wilbur was unquestionably a genius. Orville had such mechanical ingenuity as few had ever seen. That they had no more than a public high school education and little money never stopped them in their mission to take to the air. Nothing did, not even the self-evident reality that every time they took off, they risked being killed.In this enjoyable, fast-paced tale (The Economist), master historian David McCullough shows as never before how two Ohio boys from a remarkable family taught the world to fly (The Washington Post)and captures the marvel of what the Wrights accomplished (The Wall Street Journal).

As Long as Its Fun is as much a love story as it is a sea yarn, and, like all such stories, its not without complications . . . which makes it not only a sailing tale but also a human one.Reviews for As Long As It's Fun Every story needs a storyteller. The fascinating tale of Lin and Larry Pardey stretches across nearly half a century and touches much of the earth and its oceans, shared lives pulsing with adventure, creativity and passion. Herb McCormick navigates the Pardeys sprawling journey like one of their own cutters skimming along the surface of a calm sea. They lived in many worlds and McCormicks prose slips seamlessly among them, whether describing the complexities of boat construction, the breathtaking beauty and harrowing danger of global navigation or the economics of life on the fly. Lin and Larry thrived in an esoteric life of their own making; McCormick is a genial and informed guide with an insiders knowledge and a poets voice. In his hands, their journey is ours.  Tim Layden, Senior Writer, Sports Illustrated Long before Lin and Larry encouraged us to keep cruising As Long as its Fun, they exhorted us to unshackle our landlubberly chains and Go Simple, Go Small, Go Now. Four decades, many books and oceans later, the minimalist adventurers chose master storyteller Herb McCormick to bring their story home, which he has done superblyfrom childhood memories to burying the anchor in New Zealand. Serious sailors will learn things valuable about voyaging under sailand about life.  Dan Spurr, author of Steered by the Falling Stars, River of Forgotten Days Opening at an anxious moment in Taleisin near Cape Horn, Herb McCormick insightfully and vividly tells the fascinating story of the active lives and always challenging times of the most famous couple afloat. He makes clear not only how but why, after more than 170,000 miles of voyaging in wooden boats, the Pardeys remain as colorful, controversial, and influential as ever. John Rousmaniere, author, The Annapolis Book of Seamanship, Fastnet, Force 10, etc. \"Im a sailor, Ive read all their books, I thought I knew most of it. But Herb McCormicks story of the extraordinary life of Lin and Larry Pardey blew me far away. While inhabiting our world, the Pardeys discovered another one for themselves that may be the stuff of all our dreams, but is beyond the grasp of most of us. They told us that we could get there ourselves by doing as they did, but the Pardeys are hard-working, Houdini-calibre escapologists from the world the rest of us have lived in. This is in fact the rarest of tales, a story of the life two people lived that is as fabulous as the Arabian Nights, as Stanley in Africa, as any exploration of the Right Stuff in SpaceThats one part of this book. The other is the Pardeys singularly qualified biographer. Herb McCormick has written professionally about the sea and cruising sailors for forty years; he has sailed the globe from Polar icecap to Cape Horn, in every kind of boat and weather. No onenot even the Pardeyscould frame this story as clearly and contextually as Herb McCormick has in this magnificent book.
