Dr. Jeff Meldrum has put together a field guide on heavy-duty, waterproof card stock that literally fits in your back pocket or backpack, adding little weight to those ounce-sensitive backpackers with an interest in collecting data from the backcountry. Seemingly thinking of everything, Dr. Meldrum has even included a ruler along the top margin of the Guide so the researcher will always have a scale item for any photos taken in the woods.The Sasquatch Field Guide not only helps researchers with identifying possible spoor left by bigfoots, but it also helps him or her reduce the possibility of misidentifying signs of other animals for those of sasquatches. Also included in the Field Guide are easy-to-understand directions on how to gather and store data in the field in preparation for future analysis. The Guide uses colors and diagrams making it easy to read and understand, which could be the difference between successfully gathering data and blowing it when under the pressure of dealing with the real thing out in the field.Sections in the Sasquatch Field Guide include information on visual identification, footprint identification, track casting, gathering footprint metrics, hair samples, scat samples, tree breaks, nests, cultural signs, stacked rocks, habitat and distribution, diet, vocalizations, possible origins, and taphonomy. This hefty brochure-style guide is densely-packed with valuable information that all field researchers should be intimately acquainted with.\" Cliff Barackman producer of Finding Bigfoot","price":"5.47","product_url":"http://www.paracay.com/sasquatch-field-guide-folding-pocket-guide/","highlight:":"no highlight"},{"SKU":"PAR075","SKUCategory":"PCP","Title":"Saltwater Sportfish of the Pacific NW, Monterey to Alaska, Field Guide, 9781937196141, $7.95  [P065]","Title2":"Saltwater Sportfish of the Pacific NW, Monterey to Alaska, Field Guide, 9781937196141, $7.95  [P065]","Times":1,"Quantity":20,"image_url":"http://www.paracay.com/images/thumbnails/400/400/detailed/44/par075a.jpg","description":"Specifically designed for the salt water angler, this durable fish identification guide includes the fish sought after by the recreation-al fisherman in the Pacific Northwest, from Monterey to Alaska.

Its peaceful name masks a fickle character though-serene and idyllic at times but also turbulent and merciless. . Marking the shores of this largest ocean with lights and buoys presented enormous challenges. The DeWire Guide to Lighthouses of Alaska, Hawai'i and Pacific Territories details that struggle and offers travelers and armchair tourists a glimpse of some little-known sentinels in distant places. The U. S. territories of the Pacific are detailed, including two that eventually became our 49th and 50th states in 1959, along with Guam and the Northern Marianas, American Samoa, and a sprinkling of small, far-flung islands made famous by World War II battles and celebrities like Amelia Earhart. Profiles of the lighthouses are complemented by travel information and archival and contemporary images. Also included are the stories of lightkeepers, lighthouse optics, and the fleet of vessels that built and maintained the lights. A bonus section tells the little-known history of buoys-those faithful and colorful markers of waterways worldwide. . Author Bio-. Elinor DeWire has been researching, photographing, and writing about lighthouses since 1972. She is the author of seventeen lighthouse books and more than 150 articles on lighthouses and is the recipient of the Ben Franklin Book Award and the Coast Guard Book Award. Former Coast Guard Historian, Dr. Robert Scheina, calls her \"America's most prolific lighthouse author. \" She has been honored for her work by the U. S. Coast Guard, the National League of American Pen Women, the U. S. Lighthouse Society, and the American Lighthouse Foundation. . Reviews-. Everyone in the lighthouse community is familiar with Elinor DeWire's previous lighthouse books, but in my opinion, she has outdone herself with The DeWire Guide to Lighthouses of Alaska, Hawaii and the U. S. Pacific Territories. The book, with its mix of historic and modern images, provides an amazing insight to many of our nation's most rugged lighthouse outposts. As well as teaching the reader the basics of why and how the lighthouses were built, she has provided amazing stories of hardship, mystery, intrigue, and tragedy, as well as stories of the warmth and closeness of family lighthouse life that most of us could never imagine in this modern era. Couple that with the great layout and design of the book, and you have, what I call \"A Good Read,\" one that you will not want to put down. Timothy Harrison, Editor &amp; Publisher - Lighthouse Digest Magazine. . For nearly four decades, Elinor DeWire has been producing some of the finest published work on lighthouse history, and in the process she has become a seminal figure in the movement to preserve these symbols of maritime heritage. With The DeWire Guide to Lighthouses of Alaska, Hawai'i, and the U. S. Pacific Territories both perspectives are present, and she adds yet another volume to her impressive canon of published work on lighthouses. This latest edition provides the lighthouse enthusiast or student of maritime studies with a valuable reference work that underscores the importance of the lighthouses, and their keepers, in the development of these geographic areas that historically were largely dependent on maritime commerce for their economic existence. . Donald J. Terras, President - American Lighthouse Coordinating Committee. . Elinor DeWire's new book is a must-have for all lighthouse aficionados and curious travelers who want to explore the rich maritime history of Alaska, Hawaii, and America's territories in the Pacific. I love the rich detail and great stories of the lighthouses' construction and the lives of the keepers. And the stories about lighthouses on remote Pacific islands was a revelation to a history buff like myself. .

Frigid temperatures brought pack ice that filled the waters north of the Bering Strait. As a result, virtually the entire North American whaling fleet was trapped, stranding 300 men to die of starvation and exposure. Three escaping ships raised the alarm. Answering the call, three officers from the early U. S. Coast Guard and two missionaries volunteered to travel over 1,500 miles through the Arctic winter to reach the shipwrecked whalers. The rescuers' perilous four-month journey, through mountainous territory and barren sub-zero landscapes never before traversed, was fraught with blizzards, wolves, steep terrain, unstable ice, hunters, and bone-piercing cold. Unaware that a rescue team was on the way, the shipwrecked men endured freezing temperatures, malnutrition, and scurvy before falling into general lawlessness. Their struggles and those of the rescuers are meticulously recreated here from century-old journals. This extraordinary chronicle of hardship and heroism will take you to the heart of one of America's greatest maritime disasters-and the greatest Arctic rescue story in history. .

Drawing from his personal and professional background as an educator, guide, writer, and father, Peter reminds his readers of the adventurous pleasure of the great outdoors. This book teaches why children need nature in their lives, how to begin and continue going on adventures with them, and how to enjoy the process along the way. Combining proof of the need for returning to nature in a country increasingly alarmed by its health with an approachable, fun reintroduction to hiking, camping, and exploring, LET THEM BE EATEN BY BEARS marries the manifesto to the handbook. Founded on the ethics, mantras, and survival prompts of the author's outdoor programme, LET THEM BE EATEN BY BEARS is a natural extension of Richard Louv's LAST CHILD IN THE WOODS. Louv details the problem. Peter explains where and how to go from here. And with rising childhood obesity, ADHD, and technological addiction, this book has never been more timely. Peter has ten years of experience guiding hundred of young people - ages one to nineteen - on rock climbing trips, rafting trips, map and compass courses, in caves, and on backpacking trips, and this book will teach others to do the same. It will help adults - from stay-at-home parents to secondary school teachers to survival course instructors - feel empowered and capable. This is a book about fun versus fear in the natural world, leaving the mobile phone behind, getting dirty, and reading and integrating literature that will inspire readers to go out even more.","price":"14.40","product_url":"http://www.paracay.com/let-them-be-eaten-by-bears-a-fearless-guide-to-taking-our-kids-into-the-great-outdoors-clone/","highlight:":"no highlight"},{"SKU":"PER146","SKUCategory":"ZRH","Title":"Good Night Baby Animals,  9781602194991, $9.95 [1261]","Title2":null,"Times":1,"Quantity":1,"image_url":"http://www.paracay.com/images/thumbnails/400/400/detailed/45/PER146B.jpg","description":"Certain to become a childhood classic, this adorable book touches the heartstrings of inquisitive young readers as they explore the super-cute baby animal kingdom.

Focusing on the Northern Rocky Mountains of the United States and Canada, the book describes twenty species of animals and plants that contribute to the reclamation and renewal of the charcoal forest. Why do some beetles fly toward a fire? Why will you almost never see a black-backed woodpecker outside of burned areas? How do fires help grow yummy treats like huckleberries and morel mushrooms? Kids and adults will delight in discovering the answers to these and other burning questions-and don't forget to find the black-backed woodpecker in every picture!","price":"7.20","product_url":"http://www.paracay.com/the-charcoal-forest-how-fire-helps-animals-and-plants/","highlight:":"no highlight"},{"SKU":"MOU093","SKUCategory":"ZRH","Title":"PACIFIC NORTHWEST NATURE, 9781680510928, $12.95 [1019]","Title2":null,"Times":1,"Quantity":0,"image_url":"http://www.paracay.com/images/thumbnails/400/400/detailed/43/mou093.jpg","description":" 30 black-and-white line art images to color Illustrations include iconic Pacific Northwest flora, fauna, national parks, and more Compact size for taking on road trips, camping weekends, and hikesThrow this into your pack and color at your lake destination during lunch or in your tent at last light.
