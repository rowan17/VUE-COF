Thecomments and tips on tactics,as well as weather overviews for each ocean, were contributed by meteorologists and routers specialising in those ocean areas.The new edition has been reformatted to incorporate anew feature: monthly windgramsfor the most sailed ocean routes.Windgrams are a summary of wind strength and direction derived from the individual windroses along a specific ocean route. They will greatly simplify the work of planning specific ocean passages by showing at a glance a visual summary of wind conditions along the entire length of a chosen route.The first edition, published in 2012, was based on satellite observations undertaken in the previous 20 years (1991-2011).The second edition is fully revised and updatedby incorporating data gathered during the last five years (2011-2016).The data now spans 25 years and reflects any changes that have occurred during this latest period.Although the initial edition of the atlas was aimed at owners of sailing yachts, because there is no other publication dealing with offshore weather conditions, the atlas has also been bought by owners of motor-yachts, cruise ship companies, commercial fishing boats, and even military naval ships.","price":"53.97","product_url":"http://www.paracay.com/cornells-ocean-atlas-2nd-edition/","highlight:":"no highlight"},{"SKU":"PAR325","SKUCategory":"PCP","Title":"2025 NAUTICAL ALMANAC, 9781951116910 ***ONLY 10% Returnable ***$29.95","Title2":"2025 NAUTICAL ALMANAC, 9781951116910 ***ONLY 10% Returnable ***$29.95","Times":4,"Quantity":23,"image_url":"http://www.paracay.com/images/thumbnails/400/400/detailed/50/book_2025_nautical_almanac_book_paracay.png","description":"The cornerstone for all celestial navigation, listing the celestial bodies used for navigation, a sight reduction table, and other information valuable to the offshore navigator.

Young readers will absorb from labeled drawings many sailing fundamentals: basic nautical terms, points of sailing, channel markers and buoys, safety equipment, a few knots and bends, something about clouds and weather, anchoring, handling sails, and even crew overboard procedures.","price":"9.59","product_url":"http://www.paracay.com/first-sail/","highlight:":"no highlight"},{"SKU":"NO_18740","SKUCategory":"NOAA","Title":"HISTORICAL NOAA Chart 18740: San Diego to Santa Rosa Island, 37 x 50, $24.95 [ TP ]","Title2":"HISTORICAL NOAA Chart 18740: San Diego to Santa Rosa Island, 37 x 50, $24.95 [ TP ]","Times":9,"Quantity":22,"image_url":"http://www.paracay.com/images/thumbnails/400/400/product/18/18740.jpg","description":"Always printed on-demand using the current NOAA dataTraditional and Waterproof formats meetUSCG carriagerequirements for commercial vessels (Small Format do not meet this requirement)Printed by NOAA certified chart agent Paradise Cay PublicationsExcellent QualityThis chart covers the following regions: Pacific Coast, Point Sur to San Diego, Point Sur to San Diego.","price":"13.72","product_url":"http://www.paracay.com/noaa-chart-18740/","highlight:":"no highlight"},{"SKU":"IHP_CHC001*","SKUCategory":"INH","Title":"Charlie's Charts: WESTERN COAST OF MEXICO AND BAJA, 9781937196356, $79.95..","Title2":"Charlie's Charts: WESTERN COAST OF MEXICO AND BAJA, 9781937196356, $79.95..","Times":9,"Quantity":22,"image_url":"http://www.paracay.com/images/thumbnails/400/400/detailed/25/chc003.jpg","description":"This all new edition is a totally updated cruising guide covering the entire Pacific coast of Mexico from The US Border, down the Baja Peninsula, around up into the Sea of Cortez all the way north to San Felipe, across to Puerto Penasco and south to Puerto Madero/Chiapas.

Within a few hours sail of each other are the generally cool City Front and the often sunny Alameda Island, busy Sausalito and sleepy Petaluma, accessible South Beach Harbor and remote China Camp. In this updated version of theCruising Guide to San Francisco Bay, sailors can learn the locations of all the open anchorages and marinas in and around San Francisco, from as far south as Half Moon Bay to Bodega Bay to the north. This newly revised edition includes all new charts and photographs, the photographs taken from shore, from our boat, and from our friend and fellow sailor Jack Wigmores airplane to make it easier for Bay Area boaters to visualize the anchorages and marinas as they explore this amazing area. This new edition is the result of our having researched each destination thoroughly to be certain the information included herein is up-to-date. This latest edition is also easier to use than ever before because the images and most of the charts are in color. Even most long-time San Francisco Bay sailors will find something fresh in this comprehensive revised edition of Cruising Guide to San Francisco Bay.THE AUTHORSCarolyn and Bob Mehaffy had a boat in various San Francisco marinas from 1969 until 1997, when they began a seventeen-year cruise to destinations in Hawaii, Puget Sound, Alaska, Mexico, Central America, South America, and the Caribbean aboard their Hardin 45 ketch, Carricklee. During the 18 years they had their boat in the San Francisco area before leaving for their long cruise, they made many trips to marinas and anchorages in the area. They also made many trips from the Bay Area to marinas and anchorages outside the Bay, exploring destinations along the Pacific Coast as far north as Crescent City and as far south as the Channel Islands off Southern California. In 2014 the authors returned Carricklee to the San Francisco Bay Area to facilitate their research for the revision of this book.Other books by Carolyn and Bob Mehaffy are Destination Mexico (1995) and Cruising Guide to the Hawaiian Islands(1998). Articles by one of both of the authors have appeared in all the major nautical publications over the past 40 years.","price":"27.47","product_url":"http://www.paracay.com/cruising-guide-to-san-francisco-bay-3rd-edition/","highlight:":"no highlight"},{"SKU":"IHP_SFC2","SKUCategory":"INH","Title":"Spanish for Cruisers 2nd Edition, 9780967590523, $34.95","Title2":"Spanish for Cruisers 2nd Edition, 9780967590523, $34.95","Times":6,"Quantity":19,"image_url":"http://www.paracay.com/images/thumbnails/400/400/detailed/29/51ZfpnKNNvL._SY391_BO1%2C204%2C203%2C200_.jpg","description":"THIS IS NOW A PRINT-ON-DEMAND TITLE.This second edition of the popular Spanish for Cruisers has been greatly expanded so that it now covers ALL the language and vocabulary necessary to cruise the Spanish-speaking countries of the Caribbean, Central and South America and Europe.

In spite of all the advances in electronics and aids to navigation, any prudent navigator planning a longer voyage should continue to refer to pilot charts as valuable sources of information on weather conditions, tropical storm seasons and critical areas, as well as prevailing winds and currents.In the 12 years since the first edition of this atlas was published there has been a marked intensification of the effects of global warming on weather conditions throughout the world. In this fully revised and updated edition the main focus is on all changes that may affect offshore voyages.One of the most noticeable phenomenon is the decrease in the regularity and reliability of trade winds, as witnessed by sailors on some of the frequently travelled ocean routes. However, the most significant and visible change has been the increased intensity and extent of tropical cyclones, both in the duration of the critical seasons and the areas affected. As this phenomenon has such a major impact on voyage planning, and safety generally, in order to provide a full perspective on the current situation, this new edition contains all relevant facts for every area of the world that is affectedby tropical cyclones.To present an accurate picture of the actual weather conditions that prevail in the worlds oceans, the pilot charts featured in this atlas are based on the data collected by a network of meteorological satellites, augmented by observations obtained from meteorological buoys and other sources, during the last twenty-five years. The most detailed information is displayed in windroses, with every single windrose being based on a total of 218,000 samples of data.The windrose arrows fly with the wind and the length of each arrow shows the percentage of the total number of observations in which the wind has blown from that cardinal point. The number of feathers shows the force of the wind, which has been recorded most frequently from that sector. The wind force is measured on the Beaufort scale, with each feather being equivalent to one unit of wind force, so that four feathers represent average force 4 winds from that direction for that month. In areas with prevailing winds, the resulting arrow would be too long to be shown in its entirety, in which case for percentages higher than 25, the percentage is shown numerically on the shaft. The figure in the centre of each windrose gives either the percentage of calms in blue (less than force 2), or the percentage of storms in red (more than force 7), whichever is greater.Ocean currents are shown as green arrows indicating their prevailing direction and rate in knots. Variable currents are shown as a dotted arrow, its direction being determined by the highest percentage of currents recorded to set in that direction.The windrose arrows fly with the wind and the length of each arrow shows the percentage of the total number of observations in which the wind has blown from that cardinal point. The number of feathers shows the force of the wind, which has been recorded most frequently from that sector. The wind force is measured on the Beaufort scale, with each feather being equivalent to one unit of wind force, so that four feathers represent average force 4 winds from that direction for that month. In areas with prevailing winds, the resulting arrow would be too long to be shown in its entirety, in which case for percentages higher than 25, the percentage is shown numerically on the shaft. The figure in the centre of each windrose gives either the percentage of calms in blue (less than force 2), or the percentage of storms in red (more than force 7), whichever is greater.Ocean currents are shown as green arrows indicating their prevailing direction and rate in knots. Variable currents are shown as a dotted arrow, its direction being determined by the highest percentage of currents recorded to set in that direction.Hurricane area North Atlantic JulyThe extent of the ocean areas affected by tropical storms are highlighted on the monthly charts where they occur. The highlighted section only shows the area where the system had reached the intensity of a become a tropical cyclonic storm. The extent of those areas is based on the recorded tracks of such storms in recent years. This feature is a new addition to the current edition of the atlas and has been included to indicate clearly the areas that should be avoided during the critical seasons.Cyclones areas North Pacific JulyAlso shown on each monthly chart are three phenomena of particular interest to offshore navigators: the approximate monthly extent of the Intertropical Convergence Zone, the areas affected by tropical storms during the critical months, and the mean location of high-pressure cells for each hemisphere and month of the year. The approximate location of the high-pressure cell is shown for each month.Sidebars with tactical suggestions have been added to the months when most passages are undertaken in a specific area. Some of the comments and tips on tactics were contributed by meteorologists and weather routers specialising in those oceanic areas.The safety factor in voyage planning is now even more important than in the past. With careful planning, and by being aware of the consequences of climate change, tropical storm seasons, and critical areas can still be avoided. Bearing in mind the changed circumstances, these are the basic safety measures that should be adhered to when planning a voyage now or in the near future.Arriving in the tropics too close to the start of the cyclone-free season should be avoided, and a safe margin should be allowed by leaving a critical area before the end of the safe period.Cruising during the critical period in an area affected by tropical storms should be avoided. Those who plan to do so should monitor the weather carefully and make sure to be close to a place where shelter could be sought in an emergency.Caution lies at the heart of voyage planning, and this atlas will make it possible to plan a safe voyage even in these changing times. For those who plan a voyage in the near future, this atlas will provide a useful tool in planning, preparing, and bringing a journey to a safe and happy conclusion.","price":"59.97","product_url":"http://www.paracay.com/cornells-ocean-atlas-3rd-edition-clone/","highlight:":"no highlight"},{"SKU":"SPC066","SKUCategory":"ZRH","Title":"ABCs of Boating Terms, 9780764339820, $6.99 [2567]","Title2":null,"Times":5,"Quantity":12,"image_url":"http://www.paracay.com/images/thumbnails/400/400/detailed/25/SPC066.jpg","description":"This book will have kids coloring their way to learning about boating.

He then goes on to swallow progressively larger sea creatures, each meant to catch the preceding one. Every new introduction is followed by a retelling of all the previously eaten animals, and \"I don't know why he swallowed the krill -- It'll make him ill.\" The sailor's tale finally ends when he swallows a whale, \"then with a burp ? set sail.\" The burp allows all the other creatures to be released out of his mouth and back into the sea, presenting the surprise of a happier ending for the sailor than for the old lady in the song. The story is perfectly complemented by Cassandra Allen's jaunty, simple and playful illustrations, which provide a terrific source of visual clues for pre-readers looking to recognize words. The rhyming and repetition will make this a favorite read-aloud choice for storytime, as children will happily participate in reading the repeated sections, which are so easily and quickly memorized. In addition, there is a \"Fishy Facts\" spread at the back of the book that contains a true fact about each animal in the story (including \"A blue whale can eat millions of krill a day!\"), which would make for a fantastic introduction to a discussion on the size of sea creatures and the food chain.","price":"10.17","product_url":"http://www.paracay.com/there-was-an-old-sailor/","highlight:":"no highlight"},{"SKU":"CMP018","SKUCategory":"ZRH","Title":"Nautical Rules of the Road 4th ed, 9780870335785, $40  [001541]","Title2":null,"Times":9,"Quantity":10,"image_url":"http://www.paracay.com/images/thumbnails/400/400/product/5/CMP018.jpg","description":"This fourth edition has been designed for recreational boaters, maritime students and professionals.

As Long as Its Fun is as much a love story as it is a sea yarn, and, like all such stories, its not without complications . . . which makes it not only a sailing tale but also a human one.Reviews for As Long As It's Fun Every story needs a storyteller. The fascinating tale of Lin and Larry Pardey stretches across nearly half a century and touches much of the earth and its oceans, shared lives pulsing with adventure, creativity and passion. Herb McCormick navigates the Pardeys sprawling journey like one of their own cutters skimming along the surface of a calm sea. They lived in many worlds and McCormicks prose slips seamlessly among them, whether describing the complexities of boat construction, the breathtaking beauty and harrowing danger of global navigation or the economics of life on the fly. Lin and Larry thrived in an esoteric life of their own making; McCormick is a genial and informed guide with an insiders knowledge and a poets voice. In his hands, their journey is ours.  Tim Layden, Senior Writer, Sports Illustrated Long before Lin and Larry encouraged us to keep cruising As Long as its Fun, they exhorted us to unshackle our landlubberly chains and Go Simple, Go Small, Go Now. Four decades, many books and oceans later, the minimalist adventurers chose master storyteller Herb McCormick to bring their story home, which he has done superblyfrom childhood memories to burying the anchor in New Zealand. Serious sailors will learn things valuable about voyaging under sailand about life.  Dan Spurr, author of Steered by the Falling Stars, River of Forgotten Days Opening at an anxious moment in Taleisin near Cape Horn, Herb McCormick insightfully and vividly tells the fascinating story of the active lives and always challenging times of the most famous couple afloat. He makes clear not only how but why, after more than 170,000 miles of voyaging in wooden boats, the Pardeys remain as colorful, controversial, and influential as ever. John Rousmaniere, author, The Annapolis Book of Seamanship, Fastnet, Force 10, etc. \"Im a sailor, Ive read all their books, I thought I knew most of it. But Herb McCormicks story of the extraordinary life of Lin and Larry Pardey blew me far away. While inhabiting our world, the Pardeys discovered another one for themselves that may be the stuff of all our dreams, but is beyond the grasp of most of us. They told us that we could get there ourselves by doing as they did, but the Pardeys are hard-working, Houdini-calibre escapologists from the world the rest of us have lived in. This is in fact the rarest of tales, a story of the life two people lived that is as fabulous as the Arabian Nights, as Stanley in Africa, as any exploration of the Right Stuff in SpaceThats one part of this book. The other is the Pardeys singularly qualified biographer. Herb McCormick has written professionally about the sea and cruising sailors for forty years; he has sailed the globe from Polar icecap to Cape Horn, in every kind of boat and weather. No onenot even the Pardeyscould frame this story as clearly and contextually as Herb McCormick has in this magnificent book.

The book then covers the fundamental rules that always apply to sailors along with a detailed look at the rules around luffing and keeping clear  which were an eye-opener to many sailors when they were first published in the last edition.As always, throughout the book, the emphasis is on the practical impact on you as a sailor, rather than a theoretical discussion of the rules themselves.This is brought to life in the rest of the book, which takes you around the racecourse, from start to finish, through the key situations that frequently occur showing, from the point of view of each boat in turn, what you may, must or must not do. (Other rules guides take you through the rules in order which is just not how you come across them on the racecourse.)You dont have to know all the rules off by heart, but you do need to know your rights and obligations on the water  the rules can be looked up afterwards.

Plus this book includes other crucial factors of ocean navigation besides just finding out where you are from the stars, such as logbook procedures, dead reckoning, error analysis, route planning, and more. At the end of this book, you will be ready for ocean navigation. The book includes: text, practice problems, tables selections, detailed glossary, and full solutions. Printable work forms, plotting sheets, and other resources are available at no charge from www.starpath.com/celnavbook. Preface to the Second Edition. We are pleased to say that after ten more years of using this text we do not find reason to change the basic approach and methods of the teaching. We still use most of the same examples, which are now quite old, but that is the beauty of celestial navigation. It has not changed, so we do not benefit in any way from making all new examples, which would bring with them more chance of error in a book of many numbers. We have, however, notably improved and expanded the book. Each section has been updated and reformatted for a clearer presentation, often in response to student questions over the years. New graphics have been added and older ones all updated. There is much new content in the text, especially in the In-Depth chapter, including more detailed discussion of the sailings and more background on the principles. New sections were added on general ocean navigation and optimizing the fixes. We have also updated the electronic navigation section, as most ocean navigators will also be using other tools besides celestial.","price":"23.40","product_url":"http://www.paracay.com/celestial-navigation-a-complete-home-study-course-second-edition/","highlight:":"no highlight"},{"SKU":"NO_19004SF","SKUCategory":"NOAA","Title":"Small Format HISTORICAL NOAA Chart 19004: Hawai'ian Islands, 21 x 29, $14.95 [ SF ]","Title2":"Small Format HISTORICAL NOAA Chart 19004: Hawai'ian Islands, 21 x 29, $14.95 [ SF ]","Times":3,"Quantity":5,"image_url":"http://www.paracay.com/images/thumbnails/400/400/detailed/22/19004.jpg","description":"   Always printed on-demand using the current NOAA data  Traditional and Waterproof formats meetUSCG carriagerequirements for commercial vessels (Small Format do not meet this requirement)  Printed by NOAA certified chart agent Paradise Cay Publications  Excellent QualityThis chart covers the following regions: Hawai'ian & Pacific Islands, Hawai'ian Islands (Greater Archipelago), Hawai'ian Islands (Greater Archipelago).","price":"8.22","product_url":"http://www.paracay.com/small-format-noaa-chart-190042/","highlight:":"no highlight"},{"SKU":"INT465","SKUCategory":"ZRH","Title":"Sailing a Serious Ocean, 9780071704403, $28.00  [SP230]","Title2":null,"Times":2,"Quantity":5,"image_url":"http://www.paracay.com/images/thumbnails/400/400/detailed/28/int465.jpg","description":"\"I know you'll want to read more after you finishSailing a Serious Ocean.

Certainly, anyone contemplating, or preparing for, off shore passages would want to read and then keep this volume aboard. A 50 day passage from Japan to Victoria, Ca ada in 1979 provides Lin a base for discussing everything from menus to clothing, to choosing a fresh chicken, to dealing with port officials, to preventing sea sickness, to buying liquor abroad as well as the best material for underwear.Lin and Larry have been full time cruisers and professional sailors for some 40 plus years, it s all that they do. They ve learned a lot and a great deal of their wisdom appears in this book, where specific situations mix with general guidelines. As a bonus, Lin writes very well. She s able to seamlessly tie one subject to the next in a style that seems like great conversation rather than reading a how-to-do-it text. By structuring the flow of information in and around the process of food preparation while experiencing the joys and travails of a very long passage, she provides the reader with a good cruising tale enhanced with a thousand useful tips. Tips vary from entertaining aboard to coping with money transfers. There are great tips on provisioning in foreign ports as well as a strong suggestion to only go a short distance before anchoring following a farewell party.Excellent chapters will help insure your crew stays healthy and well rested. Others deal with creating an ideal galley. From big ideas to small tips, all are presented logically and with useful illustrations. Learn why credit cards are safer to use than debit cards, how to keep eggs for up to 3 months without refrigeration. How you can determine which engine parts are likely to fail, which plastic material makes the best water jugs, how Lin outsmarted weevils and learned to bake fresh bread. Find out which galley layout works best offshore. Rain water catchers how to make the best kind. On board trash collection and dealing with \"black water\" in boats lacking holding tanks. Which cutlery and dinnerware holds up best. Standing watches, getting rest and using Dramamine as a sleeping aid. The book covers everything from the value of \"a little black cocktail party dress\" to the safety of double sinks. Finally, intertwined in the cornucopia of wisdom is meal after nourishing meal sure to lift the spirits of a weary crew. Those recipes and cooking tips alone make for a book of great value. All the other info is just priceless gravy.This fourth edition of The Care and Feed of Sailing Crew incorporates ideas and information gathered by Lin and Larry during their more recent voyages through the Line Islands and south through the Pacific to New Zealand. The majority of chapters have been expanded to include the most up-to-date information on sources, supplies and new technology.

Ever since the 1930s, when Adlard Coles published the original version, this seminal work has been steadily upgraded and updated. The three compilers who have looked after it since its inception have never tired. Under the Imray / Cunliffe house flag since 1992, it represents more than 80 years of effort.This is the seventh Imray edition. The main text is organised into defined sections, each prefaced by comprehensive passage notes written by a seaman who has been there many times and which lift the work far above a simple harbour guide. The pilot also includes a valuable 'hand on the shoulder' for Channel navigation as well as vital help with handling the increasing bureaucracy on both sides of the water.The top-class pilotage notes, the plans, the aerial and approach shots for harbours great and small are unbeatable, while the author's sometimes alarmingly frank remarks about shoreside facilities, forewarning mariners of impending disappointments as well as guiding them to unexpected delights, have become a legend. As a guide and a shipmate, there is simply nothing like it.","price":"73.11","product_url":"http://www.paracay.com/shell-channel-pilot-8th-edition/","highlight:":"no highlight"},{"SKU":"NO_18751","SKUCategory":"NOAA","Title":"HISTORICAL NOAA Chart 18751: Los Angeles and Long Beach Harbors, 36 x 46, $24.95 [ TP ]","Title2":"HISTORICAL NOAA Chart 18751: Los Angeles and Long Beach Harbors, 36 x 46, $24.95 [ TP ]","Times":3,"Quantity":4,"image_url":"http://www.paracay.com/images/thumbnails/400/400/product/18/18751.jpg","description":"This chart has been canceled by NOAA as of 08/30/2023and is no longer maintained with updated data.Chart is NOT up-to-date since it is out of continual maintenance Chart is NOT updated daily and being printed on demand will NOT provide the latest published data possibleThis is NOT the most fully corrected, up-to-date U.S. charts availableChart is NOT updated weekly and does NOT include all of the latest Notice to Mariners corrections.The data from which this POD chart is produced is NOT certified by NOAA for navigation use, and is NOT correct to the date of printingFuture Notice to Mariners corrections will NOT be applied to this chartThis product will NOT meet U.

So write Lin and Larry Pardey in this, the third edition of their highly regarded Storm Tactics Handbook. As in the first two editions of this book, they describe their concerns about the tendency of modern sailors to discard the classic methods used to bring sailing vessels of all sizes from vast clipper ships to tiny yachts through amazingly strong winds and heavy seas.There is only one storm tactic that has the ability to sap the power of breaking seas, they explain. With clear and concise diagrams, they proceed to show how heaving-to works and how even the most modern of yachts can be made to heave-to, whether with only sail power or with the assistance of a sea anchor. A discussion of the many ways heaving-to can be useful at sea as a way to help the crew keep well rested, to effect repairs, to steady a vessel should outside assistance ever be necessary will convince even those who plan to run before their imagined ultimate storm that heaving-to is still a must know.A series of user-friendly checklists will help sailors from the moment they start looking for their perfect offshore boat, through outfitting, and as they encounter their first storms at sea. Highly readable stories of the Pardeys encounters with storms, and of experiences related by several other modern sailors, help illustrate and expand the points made in this book.Since writing the previous edition of Storm Tactics Handbook, Lin and Larry have voyaged an additional 35,000 miles. This has taken them as far north as Norway, twice across the Atlantic, south to Argentina, into the Pacific, around Cape Horn against the prevailing winds, and then on a circuit of the North Pacific. With insights gained from these recent voyages, they have fully revised and expanded this text by more than 40 percent, including nine completely new chapters.New material includes: Lessons from Cape Horn An interview with the late Sir Peter Blake, on storm survival and heaving-to Heaving-to using a Galerider on 55-foot Morgan s Cloud Adding rudder protection stops Discussions on avoiding chafe, building and using storm staysails, choosing storm gear, deploying para-anchors, avoiding the worst areas of cyclonic storms, and many more have been expanded to answer many questions posed by readers and seminar attendees. Mario Vittone, a U. S. Coast Guard rescue swimmer for 14 years, in an unsolicited testimony, wrote: I have been on several rescues (and heard of many more) that would have been completely unnecessary if the sailboat captains aboard would have practiced the skills taught by Lin and Larry Pardey. Not knowing how to heave-to in bad weather is as inexcusable as not knowing red, right, return.Previous editions of Storm Tactics Handbook have sold more than 32,000 copies worldwide. As recently as November 2007, the second edition ten years after its publication was consistently #1 on Amazon. com for instructional sailing books and #2 for atmospheric science. The companion DVD, Storm Tactics is also available.","price":"12.62","product_url":"http://www.paracay.com/storm-tactics-handbook-3rd-edition/","highlight:":"no highlight"},{"SKU":"IHP_BOWD81V2","SKUCategory":"INH","Title":"American Practical Navigator Bowditch 1981 Vol 2 (PAPERBACK 8 x 10), 9781937196264, $74.95","Title2":"American Practical Navigator Bowditch 1981 Vol 2 (PAPERBACK 8 x 10), 9781937196264, $74.95","Times":3,"Quantity":3,"image_url":"http://www.paracay.com/images/thumbnails/400/400/detailed/28/IHP-bowditch-1982-v-2-PERFECT-COVER-black-version.jpg","description":"Print on demand version of thistitle.

The three authors, who have each voyaged thousands of miles with children on board, provide a factual and balanced look at the realities of life on the sea. From their own experience and with information from interviews with dozens of other voyaging parents, they discuss caring for an infant on board, handling the changing needs of children as they grow, education options, ensuring parents find the private time to keep their relationships in tune, and helping children make the eventual transition back to shore life. Added to the authors voices are sidebars from other cruising parents with specialized information on subjects as diverse as handling special diets and how your children can keep in touch with friends around the world. A unique bonus chapter, written by a dozen former cruising kids looks at the long-term effects of breaking away from shoreside normalcy. A substantial appendix of resources provides invaluable further information on every subject covered in this book.It is said that every parent inflicts their lifestyle choices on their children.

Herb McCormick, Editor, Cruising World MagazineReviews for Voyaging with KidsHere are a few excerpts from these reviews, the full review is available here:A beautifully designed and very comprehensive referenceWhat these authors have done is extraordinarily valuable. Theyve done enormous research to provide access to the kind of information every parent needs before taking off, and they share real life assessment of how everything actually translates into practice. This is destined to be a bestseller in the sailing books categorythe parenting bible for the cruising family. I believe its the first book of its kind, and that is an accomplishment in itself. Daria Blackwell --- CoastalBoating.comA few days ago, I was given a pre-release PDF ofVoyaging with Kidsas a review copy. I read it over the last two evenings and I was just blown away by the wealth of information that it contains. And not just for those who are planning to cruise with kids! Carolyn Shearlock  theboatgalley.comThis is a gorgeous book with additional interviews with and input from many other cruising families. If you know of a sailing family with the dream of cruising, buy them the book and then watch their children blossom  far from the maddening crowd  into very capable, independent, and special people.

SEE PAPERBACK EDITIONThe Nautical Sextant reveals in pictures, prose, and perspective the experience and knowledge gained by the author from years of acquiring, studying, and restoring sextants from earlier times and from around the world. This fascinating book owes much of its attraction to the expert description and photos of the mechanics of the sextants and their subassemblies. It is also the story of how different manufacturers, in different times and places, solved the same mechanical problems in different ways in order to perfect one of the most accurate mechanical devices ever produced by man. All of this is complemented by an historical overview to the current day, an overview which has never been published until now. The Nautical Sextant will be of particular value not only to navigators, but also to restorers, collectors, students of technology, curators, and sextant dealers.

For those who do not wish to be caught short when modern technology fails on board, knowing how to chart a path with the aid of a sextant is an essential navigating skill. . In Celestial Navigation, veteran yachtsman, Tom Cunliffe, reveals how any boat owner can master this seafaring technique, without complex mathematics, using his simplified approach. Readers begin with a sound foundation of basic concepts and definitions, before moving on to the hardware-the sextant and how to use it. Within a few pages, you'll be working out your latitude from a noon sight, and learning how to plot a position from observing the sun, planets, moon or stars-or wherever you may be on the world's oceans.","price":"11.97","product_url":"http://www.paracay.com/celestial-navigation-3rd-edition/","highlight:":"no highlight"},{"SKU":"PDB012","SKUCategory":"PCP","Title":"CAPABLE CRUISER 3RD ED, 9781929214778, $24.95 [P-T-004/A-003/D-001]","Title2":"CAPABLE CRUISER 3RD ED, 9781929214778, $24.95 [P-T-004/A-003/D-001]","Times":1,"Quantity":2,"image_url":"http://www.paracay.com/images/thumbnails/400/400/detailed/14/CAPCRU3_200.jpg","description":"This revised and expanded third edition of a cruising classic includes 10 completely new chapters with such advice as: sixteen ways to encourage your lover (partner) to share your dream; strategies for turning sudden engine failure into a minor incident; choosing safety equipment; repairing rigging at sea.

Much has changed since the Third Edition: ereaders and computers have replaced paper maps, new types of anchors and sails have been developed, safety skills and gear are vastly improved, and many more women are commanding boats. But for all these modern developments, the basic skills and spirit of sailing remain the same. From navigation and seamanship to boat and gear maintenance, from pleasure cruising to heavy weather sailing, The Annapolis Book of Seamanship is the definitive, state-of-the-art guide that provides systematic step-by-step techniques to see you through every situation on deck and in the cockpit.","price":"33.00","product_url":"http://www.paracay.com/annapolis-book-of-seamanship-4th-edition/","highlight:":"no highlight"},{"SKU":"IHP_MMCPLL","SKUCategory":"INH","Title":"MMDREF Coast Pilots & Light Lists, 9780160419584, $49.95 [POD]","Title2":"MMDREF Coast Pilots & Light Lists, 9780160419584, $49.95 [POD]","Times":3,"Quantity":2,"image_url":"http://www.paracay.com/images/thumbnails/400/400/detailed/22/MMCPLL.png","description":"Reprints of the Coast Pilots and Light Lists used for study purposes.

Some valuable information has also been updated to accommodate the mariner undertaking this voyage. While this edition has been revised for an updated look, we have made every effort to maintain the integrity of the original book.This cruising guide provides navigation information for a boater departing from Victoria and traveling along the British Columbia and Southeast Alaskan coasts following the protected waters of the Inside Passage to Glacier Bay, Alaska.It is divided into eight sections with full-color photographs and a sketched chart indicating marinas or anchorages where a cruising boat can find moorage as it travels along the coast. Each location has a detailed sketch and description of a safe approach, recommended anchorages and shore facilities. Crucial portions such as the transit of passes and the passage of Cape Caution are given particular attention with guidelines for timing and recommended routes.A customized weather map provides excellent information. For cruisers unable to make the entire trip to Alaska shorter trips to spectacular areas on the coast are described such as to Princess Louisa Inlet, Desolation Sound, Broughton Archipelago, Fiordland Recreation Area, Kitimat and the Kitlope.THE BEST KEEPS GETTING BETTER IN THE LATEST EDITIONFeatures of this guide include:Overview planning chart of the Gulf IslandsOverview planning chart of Broughton Archipelago to Drury Inlet and Minstrel IslandFuel facilities seen at a glance on every \"chart\" FPump-out stations identified on every \"chart\" PUpdated marina websites, email addresses, telephone and fax numbersWhere are the artificial reefs?

Their books and videos have encourage sailors of all ages to stop dreaming and start doing. Now they take you well out to sea and demonstrate methods to help you bring your boat and crew safely through storms with your gear and dreams intact. Join them near South Africa's windswept Cape of Storms to watch a live demonstration of setting and retrieving a para-anchor, then sail on board Taleisin during Lin and Larry's voyages across the Atlantic, through the windswept waters off Cape Horn as they round contrary to the wind and use the storm management methods they share here. You will see their storm sails set and working in winds of 70 knots. The Pardey's use this visually explicit medium to demonstrate the technical details of storm tactics for both modern and classic boats, and they show how you can adapt their ideas for your own use.

He demonstrates the critical role of maritime trade to the civilizations of ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, and the Indus Valley. He reacquaints us with the great seafaring cultures of antiquity like those of the Phoenicians and Greeks, as well as those of India and Southeast and East Asia, who parlayed their navigational skills, shipbuilding techniques, and commercial acumen to establish thriving overseas colonies and trade routes in the centuries leading up to the age of European expansion. And finally, his narrative traces how commercial shipping and naval warfare brought about the enormous demographic, cultural, and political changes that have globalized the world throughout the postCold War era.This tremendously readable intellectual adventure shows us the world in a new light, in which the sea reigns supreme. We find out how a once-enslaved East African king brought Islam to his people, what the American sail-around territories were, and what the Song Dynasty did with twenty-wheel, human-powered paddleboats with twenty paddle wheels and up to three hundred crew. Above all, Paine makes clear how the rise and fall of civilizations can be linked to the sea. An accomplishment of both great sweep and illuminating detail, The Sea and Civilization is a stunning work of history.","price":"15.00","product_url":"http://www.paracay.com/the-sea-and-civilization-clone/","highlight:":"no highlight"},{"SKU":"NO_18685SF","SKUCategory":"NOAA","Title":"Small Format HISTORICAL NOAA Chart 18685: Monterey Bay;Monterey Harbor;Moss Landing Harbor;Santa Cruz Small...","Title2":"Small Format HISTORICAL NOAA Chart 18685: Monterey Bay;Monterey Harbor;Moss Landing Harbor;Santa Cruz Small...","Times":1,"Quantity":1,"image_url":"http://www.paracay.com/images/thumbnails/400/400/detailed/21/18685.jpg","description":"   Always printed on-demand using the current NOAA data  Traditional and Waterproof formats meetUSCG carriagerequirements for commercial vessels (Small Format do not meet this requirement)  Printed by NOAA certified chart agent Paradise Cay Publications  Excellent QualityThis chart covers the following regions: Pacific Coast, Trinidad Head to Point Sur, Trinidad Head to Point Sur.","price":"8.22","product_url":"http://www.paracay.com/small-format-noaa-chart-186852/","highlight:":"no highlight"},{"SKU":"NO_11428","SKUCategory":"NOAA","Title":"HISTORICAL NOAA Chart 11428: Okeechobee Waterway St. Lucie Inlet to Fort Myers; Lake Okeechobee,...","Title2":"HISTORICAL NOAA Chart 11428: Okeechobee Waterway St. Lucie Inlet to Fort Myers; Lake Okeechobee,...","Times":1,"Quantity":1,"image_url":"http://www.paracay.com/images/thumbnails/400/400/product/17/11428.jpg","description":"This chart has been canceled by NOAA as of  04/03/2024 and is no longer maintained with updated data.Chart is NOT up-to-date since it is out of continual maintenance Chart is NOT updated daily and being printed on demand will NOT provide the latest published data possibleThis is NOT the most fully corrected, up-to-date U.S. charts availableChart is NOT updated weekly and does NOT include all of the latest Notice to Mariners corrections.The data from which this POD chart is produced is NOT certified by NOAA for navigation use, and is NOT correct to the date of printingFuture Notice to Mariners corrections will NOT be applied to this chartThis product will NOT meet U.

A Nautical Chart is a graphic portrayal of the marine environment showing the nature and form of the coast, the general configuration of the sea bottom including water depths, locations of dangers to navigation, locations and characteristics of man-made aids to navigation and other features useful to the mariner. The Nautical Chart is essential for safe navigation. In conjunction with supplemental navigational aids, it is used by the mariner to lay out courses and navigate ships by the shortest and most economically safe route. The importance of Nautical charts is evident with over 98% of the nation's cargo carried by waterborne transportation.","price":"13.72","product_url":"http://www.paracay.com/nga-chart-550/","highlight:":"no highlight"},{"SKU":"IMR197","SKUCategory":"ZRH","Title":"Atlantic Islands 7th, 9781786790705, $104.95  [27]","Title2":null,"Times":1,"Quantity":1,"image_url":"http://www.paracay.com/images/thumbnails/400/400/detailed/44/imr197.jpg","description":"Atlantic Islands is a long-established cruising guide to the five island groups of the North Atlantic, commonly visited by those sailing the popular Atlantic crossing routes but increasingly enjoyed as cruising destinations in their own right.

These are old fiberglass boats, mostly of traditional design and strong construction. . All are small, from 20 feet to 32 feet overall, but all have crossed oceans, and all are cheap. Choosing the right boat to take you across an ocean or around the world can be confusing and exasperating, particularly with a tight budget. Vigor sets out to remedy that in this book. He compares the designs and handling characteristics of 20 different boats whose secondhand market prices start at about $3,000. Interviews with experienced owners (featuring valuable tips about handling each boat in heavy weather) are interspersed with line drawings of hulls, sail plans, and accommodations. Vigor has unearthed the known weaknesses of each boat and explains how to deal with them. He rates their comparative seaworthiness, their speed, and the number of people they can carry in comfort. If you have ever dreamed the dream this book can help you turn it into reality.","price":"10.97","product_url":"http://www.paracay.com/twenty-small-sailboats-to-take-you-anywhere-clone/","highlight:":"no highlight"},{"SKU":"FGG083","SKUCategory":"ZRH","Title":"Sibley’s Backyard Birds of Northern California,  9781621261209, $9.95 [SP005]","Title2":null,"Times":1,"Quantity":1,"image_url":"http://www.paracay.com/images/thumbnails/400/400/detailed/28/FGG083.jpg","description":"Waterproof.
