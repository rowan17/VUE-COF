The space is smaller, there's no grocery store 5 minutes away, you have fewer prepared foods and electric appliances, and food storage is much different. . Despite cruising different oceans, we-Jan and Carolyn--both faced the same challenges: eating well while having time to enjoy all the other great aspects of cruising. We love to snorkel, swim, kayak, explore-and just sit and admire the view. . We learned with the cookbooks we both had aboard, and wished for information that wasn't available--like when Jan ended up with a frozen chicken complete with head and feet and no instructions on how to cut it up. . When we couldn't get foods such as sour cream, English muffins, spaghetti sauce or yogurt, we adapted recipes to make our own. Other times, we experimented with substituting ingredients--maybe the result wasn't identical, but it was still tasty. We ended up with over 150 substitutions and dozens of \"make it yourself\" options. As we traded recipes and knowledge with each other, we realized we were compiling information that became The Boat Galley Cookbook:. 800+ recipes made from readily-obtainable ingredients with hand utensils, including numerous choices to suit every taste: not just one cake but 20, 16 ways to prepare fish, 10 regional barbeque sauces, and so on. Step-by-step directions to give even \"non-cooks\" the confidence they can turn out tasty meals without prepared foods. Detailed instructions on unfamiliar things like making yogurt and bread, grilling virtually every food imaginable, preparing and cooking freshly-caught fish and seafood, cutting up and boning meat, cooking in a Thermos and baking on the stove top, as well as lots of tips on how to do things more easily in a tiny, moving kitchen. All this in an easy-to-navigate format including side tabs on the Contents to help you find your way and extensive cross reference lists at the end of each chapter. Quick Reference Lists provide idea starters: suggestions of included recipes for such categories as Mexican, Asian, and Potluck. . The Boat Galley Cookbook is designed to help you every step of the way. We hope it becomes a trusted reference on your boat, and a source of many enjoyable meals.

As Long as Its Fun is as much a love story as it is a sea yarn, and, like all such stories, its not without complications . . . which makes it not only a sailing tale but also a human one.Reviews for As Long As It's Fun Every story needs a storyteller. The fascinating tale of Lin and Larry Pardey stretches across nearly half a century and touches much of the earth and its oceans, shared lives pulsing with adventure, creativity and passion. Herb McCormick navigates the Pardeys sprawling journey like one of their own cutters skimming along the surface of a calm sea. They lived in many worlds and McCormicks prose slips seamlessly among them, whether describing the complexities of boat construction, the breathtaking beauty and harrowing danger of global navigation or the economics of life on the fly. Lin and Larry thrived in an esoteric life of their own making; McCormick is a genial and informed guide with an insiders knowledge and a poets voice. In his hands, their journey is ours.  Tim Layden, Senior Writer, Sports Illustrated Long before Lin and Larry encouraged us to keep cruising As Long as its Fun, they exhorted us to unshackle our landlubberly chains and Go Simple, Go Small, Go Now. Four decades, many books and oceans later, the minimalist adventurers chose master storyteller Herb McCormick to bring their story home, which he has done superblyfrom childhood memories to burying the anchor in New Zealand. Serious sailors will learn things valuable about voyaging under sailand about life.  Dan Spurr, author of Steered by the Falling Stars, River of Forgotten Days Opening at an anxious moment in Taleisin near Cape Horn, Herb McCormick insightfully and vividly tells the fascinating story of the active lives and always challenging times of the most famous couple afloat. He makes clear not only how but why, after more than 170,000 miles of voyaging in wooden boats, the Pardeys remain as colorful, controversial, and influential as ever. John Rousmaniere, author, The Annapolis Book of Seamanship, Fastnet, Force 10, etc. \"Im a sailor, Ive read all their books, I thought I knew most of it. But Herb McCormicks story of the extraordinary life of Lin and Larry Pardey blew me far away. While inhabiting our world, the Pardeys discovered another one for themselves that may be the stuff of all our dreams, but is beyond the grasp of most of us. They told us that we could get there ourselves by doing as they did, but the Pardeys are hard-working, Houdini-calibre escapologists from the world the rest of us have lived in. This is in fact the rarest of tales, a story of the life two people lived that is as fabulous as the Arabian Nights, as Stanley in Africa, as any exploration of the Right Stuff in SpaceThats one part of this book. The other is the Pardeys singularly qualified biographer. Herb McCormick has written professionally about the sea and cruising sailors for forty years; he has sailed the globe from Polar icecap to Cape Horn, in every kind of boat and weather. No onenot even the Pardeyscould frame this story as clearly and contextually as Herb McCormick has in this magnificent book. This is a life story to set alongside Slocum, Scott, Amundsen, Lindberg, or Odysseus.\"   Peter Nichols, author of international bestsellers,Evolutions Captain and A Voyage for Madmen ","price":"10.42","product_url":"http://www.paracay.com/as-long-as-its-fun-the-epic-voyages-and-extraordinary-times-of-lin-and-larry-pardey/","highlight:":"highlight"}]}
