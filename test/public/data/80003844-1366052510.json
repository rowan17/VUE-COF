Along its banks stand the largest remaining redwood groves in the world. They are preserved within Humboldt Redwoods State Park. Created in 1921 with the purchase of Bolling Grove near Myers Flat by the Save the Redwoods League, the park currently preserves 53,000 acres of forestland. Within the park are structures built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s and a monolithic four-fireplace structure designed by Julia Morgan. The park also encompasses many small towns. The settlement of these towns is included in this pictorial history of Humboldt Redwoods State Park. Additionally, steps taken to preserve the redwoods are documented. Finally, floods along the river that have shaped the environment and influenced the growth of the park are also featured. Author Bio: Using images from the Humboldt Redwoods State Park Interpretive Association collection, the Fortuna Depot Museum Collection, and community members, authors Susan J. P. O-Hara and Dave Stockton weave together the many-faceted aspects of Humboldt Redwoods State Park. O-Hara is a historian and local educator, and Stockton is the director of the Humboldt Redwoods Interpretive Association.

Located approximately 200 miles north of San Francisco, this remote area of pristine beauty is comprised of jagged cliffs, rocky shorelines, and black sand beaches. It is the only significant stretch of California without a highway. Rich in natural resources, the area was once a haven for Native Americans such as the Coast Yuki, Sinkyone, Mattole, and the Wiyot. Now it is a secluded landscape with a few isolated towns surrounded by conservation areas. The famed Lost Coast Trail begins in northern Mendocino County in the Sinkyone Wilderness and continues up into Humboldt County and the King Range National Conservation Area. During the 1800s, the Lost Coast bustled with logging settlements and mill towns. After logging wound down, those towns disappeared, and only remnants of their existence remain.

Twenty years ago. The second best time? Today.Chinese proverbTwenty years ago, David Milarch, a northern Michigan nurseryman with a penchant for hard living, had a vision: angels came to tell him that the earth was in trouble. Its trees were dying, and without them, human life was in jeopardy. The solution, they told him, was to clone the champion trees of the worldthe largest, the hardiest, the ones that had survived millennia and were most resilient to climate changeand create a kind of Noahs ark of tree genetics. Without knowing if the message had any basis in science, or why hed been chosen for this task, Milarch began his mission of cloning the worlds great trees. Many scientists and tree experts told him it couldnt be done, but, twenty years later, his team has successfully cloned some of the worlds oldest treesamong them giant redwoods and sequoias. They have also grown seedlings from the oldest tree in the world, the bristlecone pine Methuselah.WhenNew York Timesjournalist Jim Robbins came upon Milarchs story, he was fascinated but had his doubts. Yet over several years, listening to Milarch and talking to scientists, he came to realize that there is so much we do not yet know about trees: how they die, how they communicate, the myriad crucial ways they filter water and air and otherwise support life on Earth. It became clear that as the planet changes, trees and forest are essential to assuring its survival.","price":"17.10","product_url":"http://www.paracay.com/the-man-who-planted-trees-a-story-of-lost-groves-the-science-of-trees-and-a-plan-to-save-the-planet-clone/","highlight:":"no highlight"},{"SKU":"IHS002","SKUCategory":"IHS","Title":"Leave Only Footprints Hexagon STICKER (10 PACK) , $30.00 [NAR-A1]","Title2":"Leave Only Footprints Hexagon STICKER (10 PACK) , $30.00 [NAR-A1]","Times":2,"Quantity":14,"image_url":"http://www.paracay.com/images/thumbnails/400/400/detailed/50/IHS002-leave-only-footprints-sticker-paracay.jpg","description":"High-quality vinyl decalMeasures 3 x 3.25 inchesLaminated for durabilityGood for indoor or outdoor useDesigned and Printed in-houseAvailable in packs of 10Comes on a hang tag with bonus mini-sticker and upc barcode10 pack ships to you shrinkwrapped for stabilityContact us for more information","price":"15.00","product_url":"http://www.paracay.com/leave-only-footprints-vinyl-sticker-10-pack/","highlight:":"no highlight"},{"SKU":"SFF006","SKUCategory":null,"Title":"BIGFOOT NATIONAL FOREST (LEAVE ONLY FOOTPRINTS) SIGN, $15.95","Title2":null,"Times":4,"Quantity":14,"image_url":"http://www.paracay.com/images/thumbnails/400/400/detailed/49/Bigfoot-national-forest-metal-sign-paracay.jpg","description":"","price":"9.57","product_url":"http://www.paracay.com/bigfoot-national-forest-metal-sign/","highlight:":"no highlight"},{"SKU":"PAR770","SKUCategory":"MAG","Title":"Sasquatch, Yeti, Bigfoot - Sculpted Pewter Keychain, $6.95 [KEY-A1]","Title2":null,"Times":3,"Quantity":14,"image_url":"http://www.paracay.com/images/thumbnails/400/400/detailed/44/yeti_pewter_on_package.jpg","description":"Beautifully crafted SQUATCH METALWORKS branded, zinc alloy finished in pewter.

What Eli knows for certain is that his mother went willingly, leaving her only son behind. For the rest of his life, Eli is obsessed with the hunt for the bizarre creature his mother chose over him, and we watch it affect every relationship he has in his long life--with his father, with both of his wives, his children, grandchildren, and colleagues. We follow all of the Roebuck family members, witnessing through each of them the painful, isolating effects of Eli's maniacal hunt, and find that each Roebuck is battling a monster of his or her own, sometimes literally. The magical world Shields has created is one of unicorns and lake monsters, ghosts and reincarnations, tricksters and hexes. At times charming, as when young Eli meets the eccentric, extraordinary Mr. Krantz, and downright horrifying at others,The Sasquatch Hunter's Almanacis boldly imaginative throughout, and proves to be a devastatingly real portrait of the demons that we as human beings all face.","price":"16.80","product_url":"http://www.paracay.com/the-sasquatch-hunters-almanac-a-novel/","highlight:":"no highlight"},{"SKU":"PAR698","SKUCategory":"MAG","Title":"Cryptid Oval KEYCHAIN, $8.95 [KEY-D4]","Title2":null,"Times":1,"Quantity":1,"image_url":"http://www.paracay.com/images/thumbnails/400/400/detailed/35/cryptid_opener.jpg","description":"Laser-cut stainless steel and stone tumbled for a weathered, distressed matte finish.
