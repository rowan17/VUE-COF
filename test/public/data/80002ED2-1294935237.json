Within a few hours sail of each other are the generally cool City Front and the often sunny Alameda Island, busy Sausalito and sleepy Petaluma, accessible South Beach Harbor and remote China Camp. In this updated version of theCruising Guide to San Francisco Bay, sailors can learn the locations of all the open anchorages and marinas in and around San Francisco, from as far south as Half Moon Bay to Bodega Bay to the north. This newly revised edition includes all new charts and photographs, the photographs taken from shore, from our boat, and from our friend and fellow sailor Jack Wigmores airplane to make it easier for Bay Area boaters to visualize the anchorages and marinas as they explore this amazing area. This new edition is the result of our having researched each destination thoroughly to be certain the information included herein is up-to-date. This latest edition is also easier to use than ever before because the images and most of the charts are in color. Even most long-time San Francisco Bay sailors will find something fresh in this comprehensive revised edition of Cruising Guide to San Francisco Bay.THE AUTHORSCarolyn and Bob Mehaffy had a boat in various San Francisco marinas from 1969 until 1997, when they began a seventeen-year cruise to destinations in Hawaii, Puget Sound, Alaska, Mexico, Central America, South America, and the Caribbean aboard their Hardin 45 ketch, Carricklee. During the 18 years they had their boat in the San Francisco area before leaving for their long cruise, they made many trips to marinas and anchorages in the area. They also made many trips from the Bay Area to marinas and anchorages outside the Bay, exploring destinations along the Pacific Coast as far north as Crescent City and as far south as the Channel Islands off Southern California. In 2014 the authors returned Carricklee to the San Francisco Bay Area to facilitate their research for the revision of this book.Other books by Carolyn and Bob Mehaffy are Destination Mexico (1995) and Cruising Guide to the Hawaiian Islands(1998).

As Long as Its Fun is as much a love story as it is a sea yarn, and, like all such stories, its not without complications . . . which makes it not only a sailing tale but also a human one.Reviews for As Long As It's Fun Every story needs a storyteller. The fascinating tale of Lin and Larry Pardey stretches across nearly half a century and touches much of the earth and its oceans, shared lives pulsing with adventure, creativity and passion. Herb McCormick navigates the Pardeys sprawling journey like one of their own cutters skimming along the surface of a calm sea. They lived in many worlds and McCormicks prose slips seamlessly among them, whether describing the complexities of boat construction, the breathtaking beauty and harrowing danger of global navigation or the economics of life on the fly. Lin and Larry thrived in an esoteric life of their own making; McCormick is a genial and informed guide with an insiders knowledge and a poets voice. In his hands, their journey is ours.  Tim Layden, Senior Writer, Sports Illustrated Long before Lin and Larry encouraged us to keep cruising As Long as its Fun, they exhorted us to unshackle our landlubberly chains and Go Simple, Go Small, Go Now. Four decades, many books and oceans later, the minimalist adventurers chose master storyteller Herb McCormick to bring their story home, which he has done superblyfrom childhood memories to burying the anchor in New Zealand. Serious sailors will learn things valuable about voyaging under sailand about life.  Dan Spurr, author of Steered by the Falling Stars, River of Forgotten Days Opening at an anxious moment in Taleisin near Cape Horn, Herb McCormick insightfully and vividly tells the fascinating story of the active lives and always challenging times of the most famous couple afloat. He makes clear not only how but why, after more than 170,000 miles of voyaging in wooden boats, the Pardeys remain as colorful, controversial, and influential as ever. John Rousmaniere, author, The Annapolis Book of Seamanship, Fastnet, Force 10, etc. \"Im a sailor, Ive read all their books, I thought I knew most of it. But Herb McCormicks story of the extraordinary life of Lin and Larry Pardey blew me far away. While inhabiting our world, the Pardeys discovered another one for themselves that may be the stuff of all our dreams, but is beyond the grasp of most of us. They told us that we could get there ourselves by doing as they did, but the Pardeys are hard-working, Houdini-calibre escapologists from the world the rest of us have lived in. This is in fact the rarest of tales, a story of the life two people lived that is as fabulous as the Arabian Nights, as Stanley in Africa, as any exploration of the Right Stuff in SpaceThats one part of this book. The other is the Pardeys singularly qualified biographer. Herb McCormick has written professionally about the sea and cruising sailors for forty years; he has sailed the globe from Polar icecap to Cape Horn, in every kind of boat and weather. No onenot even the Pardeyscould frame this story as clearly and contextually as Herb McCormick has in this magnificent book. This is a life story to set alongside Slocum, Scott, Amundsen, Lindberg, or Odysseus.\"   Peter Nichols, author of international bestsellers,Evolutions Captain and A Voyage for Madmen ","price":"10.42","product_url":"http://www.paracay.com/as-long-as-its-fun-the-epic-voyages-and-extraordinary-times-of-lin-and-larry-pardey/","highlight:":"highlight"},{"SKU":"-IHP_1981","SKUCategory":"INH","LineItemID":"Recommendation","Title":"The Nautical Almanac 1981 B&W ED, 9781937196608, $29.95","Title2":"The Nautical Almanac 1981 B&W ED, 9781937196608, $29.95","Times":"Recommended","Quantity":"Recommended","image_url":"http://www.paracay.com/images/thumbnails/400/400/detailed/22/1981_alm_new.png","description":"PRINT ON DEMAND TITLE","price":"17.97","product_url":"http://www.paracay.com/the-nautical-almanac-1981/","highlight:":"highlight"},{"SKU":"-CEL014","SKUCategory":"ZRH","LineItemID":"Recommendation","Title":"Radar Transfer Plotting Sheets, $13.95[DS]","Title2":"Radar Transfer Plotting Sheets, $13.95[DS]","Times":"Recommended","Quantity":"Recommended","image_url":"http://www.paracay.com/images/thumbnails/400/400/detailed/24/cel014.JPG","description":"Perfect for plotting radar targets, tidal current plots, and all relative motion problems. . .

Seemingly thinking of everything, Dr. Meldrum has even included a ruler along the top margin of the Guide so the researcher will always have a scale item for any photos taken in the woods.The Sasquatch Field Guide not only helps researchers with identifying possible spoor left by bigfoots, but it also helps him or her reduce the possibility of misidentifying signs of other animals for those of sasquatches. Also included in the Field Guide are easy-to-understand directions on how to gather and store data in the field in preparation for future analysis. The Guide uses colors and diagrams making it easy to read and understand, which could be the difference between successfully gathering data and blowing it when under the pressure of dealing with the real thing out in the field.Sections in the Sasquatch Field Guide include information on visual identification, footprint identification, track casting, gathering footprint metrics, hair samples, scat samples, tree breaks, nests, cultural signs, stacked rocks, habitat and distribution, diet, vocalizations, possible origins, and taphonomy.
