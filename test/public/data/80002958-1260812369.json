Seemingly thinking of everything, Dr. Meldrum has even included a ruler along the top margin of the Guide so the researcher will always have a scale item for any photos taken in the woods.The Sasquatch Field Guide not only helps researchers with identifying possible spoor left by bigfoots, but it also helps him or her reduce the possibility of misidentifying signs of other animals for those of sasquatches. Also included in the Field Guide are easy-to-understand directions on how to gather and store data in the field in preparation for future analysis. The Guide uses colors and diagrams making it easy to read and understand, which could be the difference between successfully gathering data and blowing it when under the pressure of dealing with the real thing out in the field.Sections in the Sasquatch Field Guide include information on visual identification, footprint identification, track casting, gathering footprint metrics, hair samples, scat samples, tree breaks, nests, cultural signs, stacked rocks, habitat and distribution, diet, vocalizations, possible origins, and taphonomy.

First, a cold front moved in and dropped several feet of snow. Second, a warm front called the \"pineapple connection\" moved in and released lots of rain while melting the snowfall--local measurements varied from 20 to 32 inches of rainwater in three days. And third, the highest tide of the year had backed up debris and water for several miles. At its peak, the Eel River was discharging more than 800,000 cubic feet per second.

The impressive size of the trees necessitated drastic technological advances. Many innovations were invented by Humboldt mill owners like John Dolbeer, whose steam donkey engine mechanized and revolutionized logging all along the West Coast. In 1896, there were 13 mills devoted to sawing redwood lumber and 26 mills making redwood shingles operating in Humboldt County. Other related industries, such as shipbuilding, boiler works, tanbark, and split products, further shaped the economic vitality of the county. Most of these industries no longer exist, and the logging industry is now a shadow of its former self. However, many remnants of the loggers' heyday can still be found.

Harvesting, milling, and shipping of redwood lumber provided the economic mainstay for nearly 100 years. The fertile Eel River Valley became known for its apples, potatoes, and a large dairy industry. Relative isolation ended in 1914 with the completion of the railroad from San Francisco, and in the 1920s expanded automobile traffic brought growing numbers of tourists to the redwood forests. \"Friendly Fortuna\" is a city of celebrations, known for its annual rodeo, first held in 1921. Organizations such as the Fortuna Volunteer Fire Department, founded in 1904, form the heart of the community. The Pacific Lumber Company town of Scotia, the now-vanished mill town of Newburg, and other neighboring communities such as Fernbridge--born in 1911 to house the men building what would become the world's longest concrete bridge--have also woven their stories into the tapestry of Eel River Valley history.","price":"14.99","product_url":"http://www.paracay.com/fortuna-and-the-eel-river-valley/","highlight:":"no highlight"},{"SKU":"PAR471","SKUCategory":"MAG","Title":"Bigfoot Utility tool BOTTLE OPENER w/Carabiner, $8.95 [KEY-C6]","Title2":null,"Times":4,"Quantity":18,"image_url":"http://www.paracay.com/images/thumbnails/400/400/detailed/44/bigfoot-utility-carabiner.jpg","description":"Laser-cut stainless steel and stone tumbled for a weathered, distressed matte finish.

Along its banks stand the largest remaining redwood groves in the world. They are preserved within Humboldt Redwoods State Park. Created in 1921 with the purchase of Bolling Grove near Myers Flat by the Save the Redwoods League, the park currently preserves 53,000 acres of forestland. Within the park are structures built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s and a monolithic four-fireplace structure designed by Julia Morgan. The park also encompasses many small towns. The settlement of these towns is included in this pictorial history of Humboldt Redwoods State Park. Additionally, steps taken to preserve the redwoods are documented. Finally, floods along the river that have shaped the environment and influenced the growth of the park are also featured.

This achievement was the culmination of a massive, six-year engineering effort to connect rail lines ending at Willits with the early lumber company railroads of the Humboldt Bay region. When it was completed, the NWP linked Eureka with San Francisco by rail, a milestone in the history of Humboldt and Northern Mendocino Counties. This book examines the impact of the NWP on Northwestern California. Although no longer operational, the railroad today symbolizes the ongoing struggle to connect this isolated region with the wider world.Author Bio:Authors Susan J.P.

With the same solution-minded ethic as his much-admiredThe State of Water: Understanding California's Most Precious Resource, Kaufmann presents fire as a force of regeneration rather than apocalypse. He considers the long history of ecological burns, the varied ways fire behaves across the state, and the lessons we can learn from California's largest fires of recent decades.Packed with Kaufmann's signature watercolor maps and paintings,The State of Fireconfronts one of California's most pressing social and ecological challenges. From this maelstrom Kaufmann emerges to share a deepened love for the natural worldand a refreshingly hopeful vision of California's future.","price":"16.80","product_url":"http://www.paracay.com/the-state-of-fire-why-california-burns-book/","highlight:":"no highlight"},{"SKU":"PAR839","SKUCategory":null,"Title":"UFO and Aliens Playing Cards, 745808189938, $7.95","Title2":null,"Times":2,"Quantity":10,"image_url":"http://www.paracay.com/images/thumbnails/400/400/detailed/49/UFOandAliens-PlayingCards-Paracay.jpg","description":"","price":"3.98","product_url":"http://www.paracay.com/ufos-and-aliens-playing-cards/","highlight:":"no highlight"},{"SKU":"IPS311","SKUCategory":"ZRH","Title":"West Coast Wild Rainforest, 9781773068398, $19.99 [LA007]","Title2":null,"Times":3,"Quantity":10,"image_url":"http://www.paracay.com/images/thumbnails/400/400/detailed/48/west-coast-wild-rainforest-book.jpg","description":"Step into the majestic rainforest of the Pacific west coast and discover a unique community of creatures thriving in an interconnected web of life.Towering over the sea, along the magnificent Pacific west coast, is an ancient and beautiful rainforest with a unique ecosystem that is linked in many ways. In this fourth book in the West Coast Wild series, you will find trees as tall as twenty-storey buildings, tiny seedlings sprouting on nursery logs and brightly colored salmon spawning in streams. The salmon, as a keystone species, connect the ocean to the forest and provide a rich source of food for the bears, wolves, eagles and other creatures that live in this pristine wilderness. The remains of the fish add vital nutrients to the forest, feeding the lush green plants and trees. In turn, the thick vegetation shades the streams and protects the baby salmon that hatch and swim to the sea.Author Deborah Hodge provides a clear and engaging look at the interdependence of the forest species and the fascinating cycles of nature in this rare ecosystem, while Karen Reczuchs lavish watercolors show the rainforest teeming with life in shades of green that can only come from receiving more than ten feet of rain a year.","price":"11.99","product_url":"http://www.paracay.com/west-coast-wild-rainforest-book/","highlight:":"no highlight"},{"SKU":"MOU059","SKUCategory":"ZRH","Title":"NORTHWEST FORAGING, 9781594853661, $16.95  [001906]","Title2":null,"Times":8,"Quantity":9,"image_url":"http://www.paracay.com/images/thumbnails/400/400/detailed/14/53661_%281%29.jpg","description":"* Suitable for novice foragers and seasoned botanists alike* More than 65 of the most common edible plants in the Pacific Northwest are thoroughly described*Poisonous plants commonly encountered are also included Originally published in 1974, Northwest Foraging quickly became a wild food classic.

The area immediately next to Luna had already been stripped and, because, as many believed, nothing was left to hold the soil to the mountain, a huge part of the hill had slid into the town of Stafford, wiping out many homes.Over the course of what turned into an historic civil action, Hill endured El Nino storms, helicopter harassment, a ten-day siege by company security guards, and the tremendous sorrow brought about by an old-growth forest's destruction. This story--written while she lived on a tiny platform eighteen stories off the ground--is one that only she can tell.Twenty-five-year-old Julia Butterfly Hill never planned to become what some have called her--the Rosa Parks of the environmental movement. Shenever expected to be honored as one of Good Housekeeping's \"Most Admired Women of 1998\" and George magazine's \"20 Most Interesting Women in Politics,\" to be featured in People magazine's \"25 Most Intriguing People of the Year\" issue, or to receive hundreds of letters weekly from young people around the world. Indeed, when she first climbed into Luna, she had no way of knowing the harrowing weather conditions and the attacks on her and her cause. She had no idea of the loneliness she would face or that her feet wouldn't touch ground for more than two years. She couldn't predict the pain of being an eyewitness to the attempted destruction of one of the last ancient redwood forests in the world, nor could she anticipate the immeasurable strength she would gain or the life lessons she would learn from Luna. Although her brave vigil and indomitable spirit have made her a heroine in the eyes of many, Julia's story is a simple, heartening tale of love, conviction, and the profound courage she has summoned to fight for our earth's legacy.","price":"9.59","product_url":"http://www.paracay.com/the-legacy-of-luna-the-story-of-a-tree-a-woman-and-the-struggle-to-save-the-redwoods/","highlight:":"no highlight"},{"SKU":"PAR708","SKUCategory":"MAG","Title":"Humboldt Bigfoot MAGNET, $10.95 [MAG-R1]","Title2":null,"Times":3,"Quantity":6,"image_url":"http://www.paracay.com/images/thumbnails/400/400/detailed/38/humboldt_bigfoot.jpg","description":"Laser-cut steel, stone tumbled and finished with Squatch Metalworks proprietary distressed metal patina treatment.

All official hiking trails were drawn from newly-acquired GPS data with a resolution of about 250 feet. Trail mileages are marked and most streets that have names are labeled. To help you keep track of your location, the map shows the locations of memorial grove markers, footbridges, panoramic viewpoints, and stairs. A UTM grid is provided to help with GPS navigation.Unofficial trails and dirt roads are shown and are greyed out to distinguish them from official hiking trails. I dont recommend that you use these trails, but if you accidently wander onto one, having it on the map will help you get back on track.This is the only commercially-available map of the park to show which areas have old-growth redwoods (drawn as dark green areas)  an important feature since most of the parks longer trails actually pass through second-growth forest.For the third edition, the trails were updated with new, more accurate GPS data. The rebuilt trails on the west side of the Eel River are now shown, and maps of Grizzly Creek Redwoods, Van Duzen County Park, and Standish-Hickey State Park have been added.

Within its boundaries are three California state parks--Prairie Creek Redwoods State Park, Del Norte Coast Redwoods State Park, and Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park. Between 1920 and 1960, Save the Redwoods League was able to purchase dozens of redwood parcels with the help of private donations and matching state funds. These areas can be found along the park roads and trails as dedicated groves. In 1994, the National Park Service and the California Department of Parks and Recreation signed an agreement to manage these four redwood parks cooperatively.TheRedwood National and State Parks Day HikesTopographic Map Guidecontains detailed maps for 16 of Redwoods's finest day hikes. It includes well-known hikes and some off-the-beaten-path trails. They range from easy strolls to strenuous climbs, selected to give you a sampling of all the park has to offer. Together, they cover over 75 miles of adventures. One-third of the selected hikes are less than 4 miles long, two-thirds are less than 7 miles, and one hike is more than 10 miles long.Each of the 16 maps include directions to the trailhead, the total distance to complete the hike, and an estimate of the degree of difficulty. Also provided are elevations of key points on the trail, an elevation profile for the hike, and a calculation of the hike's total elevation gain. Concise trail descriptions will help you find the hikes that best suit your interests, conditioning, and available time.Every Trails Illustrated map is printed on \"Backcountry Tough\" waterproof, tear-resistant paper.

Although its lighthouse guided many heavily laden ships to safe harbor, famous shipwrecks still lie off Del Norte's rocky coast. Pack mule teams streamed east, bound for mining camps, and ranches in the Smith River and Elk Valleys developed to supply them. River salmon became a major industry, and later the ocean's bounty supported fishermen. Redwood groves fed a thriving timber industry for over a century.

Starting with the earliest evidence of sea gardens and clam beds from 11,500 years ago, this book covers the history of oyster cultivation through contemporary aquaculture in coastal Washington, Oregon, British Columbia, northern California, and southeastern Alaska. Generations of oyster farmers, Native and non-Native, have weathered many challenges to continue the harvest. Their vivid individual accounts are braided together with significant history, such as the major contributions of Japanese immigrants prior to World War II and the 1994 Rafeedie decision that affirmed shellfish harvesting rights held by Northwest tribes. The book also sheds light on the innovations that made oysters an enduringly popular food, from the creation of so-called sexless oysters that could be consumed year-round to breakthroughs in contemporary oyster cuisine. Now fully updated and expanded - and chock-full of \"oysterabilia\" - this classic text shares new insights on emerging challenges to the oyster farmer's life as well as increased coverage of the roles of women and contemporary tribes in building this cultural tradition, past and present. Newcomers and aficionados alike will also be delighted by the carefully selected recipes, both historic and contemporary, from the region's top chefs.

And yet the man has been all but forgotten.In this illuminating biography, Andrea Wulf brings Humboldts extraordinary life back into focus: his prediction of human-induced climate change; his daring expeditions to the highest peaks of South America and to the anthrax-infected steppes of Siberia; his relationships with iconic figures, including Simn Bolvar and Thomas Jefferson; and the lasting influence of his writings on Darwin, Wordsworth, Goethe, Muir, Thoreau, and many others.
