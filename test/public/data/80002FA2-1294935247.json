These rules are designed to promote the safe and efficient operation of ships, and to prevent collisions and other accidents.The navigation rules book typically includes information on:The \"rules of the road,\" which are the specific rules that apply to the movement of vessels in different situations, such as when two vessels are approaching each other, or when a vessel is crossing the path of another vessel.Signals and signals of distress, which are the signals and procedures that are used to communicate with other vessels and to indicate when a vessel is in distress.Lights and shapes, which are the signals that are used to indicate the nature and intentions of a vessel, such as whether it is underway or at anchor.Sound signals, which are the signals that are used to communicate with other vessels using sound, such as horn blasts or whistles.Aids to navigation, which are the systems and devices that are used to help vessels navigate, such as lighthouses, buoys, and radar.The navigation rules book is an important reference for all vessel operators, as it contains important information that is necessary for the safe operation of ships.

These are practical problems that all navigators should know how to solve. Topics include: Piloting, Chart reading and plotting, Voyage planning, Dead reckoning, Compass use, Waypoint selection, Special publications, Rules of the road, Route design, Lights and buoys, Tides and currents, Electronic fixes, Depth sounding navigation The level of the exercises is comparable to that used in the USCG 100-Ton masters exam, which in turn is about the same used in the navigation certification programs of US Sailing, ASA, CYA and RYA. These practice problems are, however, designed to be practical and instructive, not just training exercises for certification exams. This Workbook is used by several navigation schools around the country. Selections are provided from each of these special publications along with exercises to insure their full use is mastered: NOAA Tide Tables, NOAA Current Tables, US Coast Pilot, USCG Light List, USCG Notices to Mariners, NOAA Chart Catalog The exercises that require a chart use nautical training chart No. 18465 Tr, available in print at reduced price from NOAA chart dealers and other outlets listed in the Appendix. You can also work the chart problems with an electronic chart (Raster Navigation Chart, RNC) number 18465 Tr. This custom echart is available as a download from www.starpath.com/18465tr. The echart can be viewed by any of several free echart viewer programs. Sources for free echart viewers and guidelines for their use are included in the Appendix. You can also use any full echart navigation program of your choice. We encourage navigators to solve the chart problems with both traditional paper plotting as well as electronically, using route tools, electronic bearing lines, and range rings.","price":"11.97","product_url":"http://www.paracay.com/navigation-workbook-18465tr-book/","highlight:":"highlight"},{"SKU":"-NO_116TR","SKUCategory":"NOAA","LineItemID":"Recommendation","Title":"HISTORICAL NOAA Training Chart 116TR: Long Island Sound, 36 x 44, $24.95 [ TP ]","Title2":"HISTORICAL NOAA Training Chart 116TR: Long Island Sound, 36 x 44, $24.95 [ TP ]","Times":"Recommended","Quantity":"Recommended","image_url":"http://www.paracay.com/images/thumbnails/400/400/product/26/no116tr.jpg","description":"Always printed on-demand using the current NOAA dataTraditional and Waterproof formats meetUSCG carriagerequirements for commercial vessels (Small Format do not meet this requirement)Printed by NOAA certified chart agent Paradise Cay PublicationsExcellent Quality","price":"9.32","product_url":"http://www.paracay.com/noaa-training-chart-116tr/","highlight:":"highlight"}]}
